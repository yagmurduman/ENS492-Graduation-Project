            "['&lt;p&gt;Younger people continue to bear the brunt of the jobs crisis amid widespread cuts in sectors such as hospitality, official figures show. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the year to March, 811,000 payroll jobs were lost in the UK, with under-35s accounting for 80% of these cuts. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data also showed the unemployment rate dipped to 4.9% in the three months to February - down from 5% previously. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was despite most of the UK being under strict lockdown rules for at least some of the period. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the jobs market \"remains subdued\", with five million people employed but still on furlough. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, Surenâ\\x80¯Thiru, said:â\\x80¯ \"Unemployment remains on course to peak towards the end of 2021, once the furlough scheme expires and those who stopped job hunting during the pandemic look to return to the workforce as restrictions ease. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Although the furlough scheme will limit the peak in job losses, the longer-term structural unemployment caused by Covid-19, particularly among young people, may mean that the road back to pre-pandemic levels lags behind the wider economic recovery.\" &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, some 1.67 million people were unemployed between December and February. That is down 50,000 on the previous quarter but still 311,000 higher than a year ago. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the ONS said younger people were suffering disproportionately, as sectors such as retail and hospitality were hit hard by the crisis. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People aged under 35 accounted for 635,000 payroll jobs lost in the year to March, with 436,000 of those positions held by people under 25. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gerwyn Davies, senior policy adviser at the Chartered Institute of Professional Development, said the number of young people in employment had hit a \"post-pandemic low\". &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"This reinforces the urgent case for apprenticeship incentives to be made more generous and targeted specifically at 18-24 year-olds. It also underlines the need to improve employers\\' awareness of traineeships and the Kickstart [work placement] Scheme.\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be wrong to get carried away with the pleasant surprise of a dip in the official unemployment rate below 5%. The real pandemic picture is in the tax data for March. 813,000 fewer payrolls on the PAYE system versus a year ago, and four fifths of those jobs were lost to under 35s.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the fact that the numbers in the first few months have been broadly stable is definitely a source of relief. Employers were able to navigate the second lockdown without widespread further job losses, thanks to the extension of support schemes such as furlough. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This provides a more solid basis than might have been expected for the phased reopening of the economy. There will be strains, especially as support is phased out in late summer. But these figures offer hope of a lower peak to unemployment, perhaps at around 6%, than had been expected. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ONS said the overall jobs market had been \"broadly stable\" in recent months after the major shock of last spring, when where the economy contracted sharply. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan said the labour market \"remains subdued\" but that there were positive signs. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"With the prospect of businesses reopening, there was a marked rise in job vacancies in March, especially in sectors such as hospitality.\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bank of England expects an economic rebound this year, as lockdown measures are eased and government support for jobs continues. But it says the recovery still depends on the \"evolution of the pandemic\".&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hannah Audino, an economist at PwC, said the stabilisation of the jobs market during the third national lockdown boded well for the UK economy. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We expect a gradual recovery in the labour market in the coming months with the reopening of hospitality and retail, provided the government\\'s roadmap to reopening the economy continues to go to plan.\"  &lt;p&gt;']\n",

            "['&lt;p&gt;Younger people continue to bear the brunt of the jobs crisis amid widespread cuts in sectors such as hospitality, official figures show. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the year to March, 811,000 payroll jobs were lost in the UK, with under-35s accounting for 80% of these cuts. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data also showed the unemployment rate dipped to 4.9% in the three months to February - down from 5% previously. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was despite most of the UK being under strict lockdown rules for at least some of the period. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the jobs market \"remains subdued\", with five million people employed but still on furlough. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, Surenâ\\x80¯Thiru, said:â\\x80¯ \"Unemployment remains on course to peak towards the end of 2021, once the furlough scheme expires and those who stopped job hunting during the pandemic look to return to the workforce as restrictions ease. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Although the furlough scheme will limit the peak in job losses, the longer-term structural unemployment caused by Covid-19, particularly among young people, may mean that the road back to pre-pandemic levels lags behind the wider economic recovery.\" &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, some 1.67 million people were unemployed between December and February. That is down 50,000 on the previous quarter but still 311,000 higher than a year ago. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the ONS said younger people were suffering disproportionately, as sectors such as retail and hospitality were hit hard by the crisis. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People aged under 35 accounted for 635,000 payroll jobs lost in the year to March, with 436,000 of those positions held by people under 25. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gerwyn Davies, senior policy adviser at the Chartered Institute of Professional Development, said the number of young people in employment had hit a \"post-pandemic low\". &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"This reinforces the urgent case for apprenticeship incentives to be made more generous and targeted specifically at 18-24 year-olds. It also underlines the need to improve employers\\' awareness of traineeships and the Kickstart [work placement] Scheme.\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be wrong to get carried away with the pleasant surprise of a dip in the official unemployment rate below 5%. The real pandemic picture is in the tax data for March. 813,000 fewer payrolls on the PAYE system versus a year ago, and four fifths of those jobs were lost to under 35s.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the fact that the numbers in the first few months have been broadly stable is definitely a source of relief. Employers were able to navigate the second lockdown without widespread further job losses, thanks to the extension of support schemes such as furlough. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This provides a more solid basis than might have been expected for the phased reopening of the economy. There will be strains, especially as support is phased out in late summer. But these figures offer hope of a lower peak to unemployment, perhaps at around 6%, than had been expected. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ONS said the overall jobs market had been \"broadly stable\" in recent months after the major shock of last spring, when where the economy contracted sharply. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan said the labour market \"remains subdued\" but that there were positive signs. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"With the prospect of businesses reopening, there was a marked rise in job vacancies in March, especially in sectors such as hospitality.\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bank of England expects an economic rebound this year, as lockdown measures are eased and government support for jobs continues. But it says the recovery still depends on the \"evolution of the pandemic\".&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hannah Audino, an economist at PwC, said the stabilisation of the jobs market during the third national lockdown boded well for the UK economy. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We expect a gradual recovery in the labour market in the coming months with the reopening of hospitality and retail, provided the government\\'s roadmap to reopening the economy continues to go to plan.\"  &lt;p&gt;']\n"

world issued new visa policies with this condition, including in the United States and the United Kingdom, where Chinese vaccines aren\\'t available&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China\\'s foreign ministry says the move is about kick-starting international travel in an \"orderly fashion\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But experts have raised concerns over China\\'s decision to prioritize domestic vaccines over those approved by the World Health Organization&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It sets a dangerous precedent which could leave the world in vaccine-based silos if other nations adopt it&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicholas Thomas, an associate professor in health security at the City University of Hong Kong, said that it\\'s very much at the end of vaccine diplomacy&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing of China\\'s new visa rules is notableAfter the Quad, a partnership between the US, India, Japan and Australia&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some saw that as a direct counter to China\\'s own vaccine diplomacy efforts, which were recently criticized by the US Secretary of State&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Chinese Mission to the UN, as of March 15, China had exported vaccines to 28 countries&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indonesia and Turkey have mass public vaccine programs&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of China\\'s vaccines have yet been approved by the WHO or have released full Phase 3 trial data, leading to a lack of clarity over how effective the vaccines really areSinovac, for example, had an efficacy rate of 5038% in late-stage trials in Brazil, lower than the 78% announced in China, and lower than the efficacy rate of other vaccines&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China can\\'t claim that its preference for home grown vaccines is due to being superior to other vaccinesThomas sees China\\'s new visa rules as a power move that will force people to take one of China\\'s vaccinesSarah Chan is a reader in the College of Medicine at the University of Edinburgh&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people can\\'t take certain shots because of their health conditions&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It is simply not justified to make so much of what we do depend on whether or not we have had a vaccine, let alone whether we have had one particular version of the vaccine,\" Chan saidDespite China\\'s new visa rules placing an incentive on travelers to take the Chinese vaccines, the spokesman for China\\'s Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejected the idea of \"vaccine nationalism\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"China stands ready to advance mutual recognition of vaccination with other countries\"What are the longer term effects?China\\'s move comes as countries around the world tackle the broader question of whether to roll out so-called \"immunity passports\" to open up international travel to people who have antibodies If immunity passport gives special rights to people who have been vaccine free, which vaccines should be counted?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow the WHO authorization is one optionOnly four vaccines, including two versions of the Oxford vaccine, have been given emergency use listing by the WHO&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccines that are approved and recognized by the most countries would set the standard, according to Thomas&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A vaccine passport for the world is a long way offFor now, countries are likely to simply recognize the vaccines they have approved for use -- and already there\\'s signs of that leading to silos&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who have had the Chinese shots may be left in the cold, because member states will only waive free movement restrictions for people who have received EU marketing authorization&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge will be interesting to watch&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It will create a certain amount of tension and will escalate this pre-existing vaccine diplomacy tension\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don\\'t know how long immunity to Covid-19 lasts, either from recovering from the virus or from vaccines, so there are other issues with immunity passportsWhile the WHO is working on a \"smart digital certificate\" that would include vaccination information, it is discouraging the use of vaccine passports for travel&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hans Kluge, WHO Europe director, said there is a global shortage of vaccines&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would increase the disparityThere are a lot of problems with immunity passports, especially high-tech digital ones that come with data privacy concerns&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that a better approach would be to make sure vaccines are as widely available as possibleImmigration authorities can use simpler approaches, like asking the public to self-report if they\\'ve had any vaccine, when most of the world\\'s population has beenvaccinated&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk to the population would be small if some people lied, she saidHe wants countries to stop treating the vaccine roll out as a race and instead treat it as a global health issue&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that the viruses don\\'t care about borders, they just want to replicate and change&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless we take a truly global approach to vaccines, and recognize that we have to simply do the best on a global level, then we\\'re going to be looking at a second wave of Covid&lt;p&gt;\n",

and female&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people in these groups prefer to be recognized for who they are, and for the markers to reflect that&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of the media attention to the birth

with quicker than the citizens who are filing the complaintWould you like to speak with the sergeants?I would like toHe was not breathingHe was not resisting arrestOne secondMurderers, broAll of them are just murderersWhen we were going to jury trial for Oscar, they would ask questions like, \\'Do you know anyone who went to jail?\\' Do you know anyone who had an encounter with the police?They would strike them from being a juror if the person said thatIt could help with the decision-making of guilty or innocent peopleThe officer pleaded not guiltyConcerns of racial tension and intense media scrutiny led to his trial being moved to Los AngelesLet\\'s just pray for a secondWe come to you and your son, Jesus ChristWhen I visit my mom\\'s house, I\\'m reminded that my son was killed hereSequette Clark is my nameI am the mother of the man who was shot and killed by the policeClark was accused of smashing a car windowHe was shot in the backyardPolice thought he was holding a gun, but now say it was a cellphoneThey fired their weapon out of fearThe officers manually muted their body cameras after the incidentMove over this wayWhen we watched the George Floyd trial, I invited certain members of my family because you can\\'t address something in the community or the city until you address it at home with the familyMr Chauvin didn\\'t help Mr Floyd when he was in distressThey left my boy out thereThey handcuffed him after he diedThe force is excessiveAfter the fact of death, there is excessive force and lethal forceI felt drained and sad400 years ago, I felt like a slaveHearing how he died, and seeing how he diedThe defense tried to bring up the fact that it took 9 minutes and 29 seconds to kill George FloydWe should focus on what happened before thatI don\\'t think anything that doesn\\'t deal with the murder of George Floyd is relevantHe is 6 to 6 and a half feet tallHe had taken heroinMr Floyd bought a pack of cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 billMr Floyd had drugs in his mouthPops is already deadGeorge Floyd is deadThat is correctThat is correctYou are resurrecting him to kill him all over againBasicallyIt reminded me of what the district attorney did to Stephon when he defamed him in order to justify the wrongdoing of your officersThe domestic violence incident that happened with the mother of his children was revealed by the cellphone examinationTexts and phone calls show that he was looking for drugs and had a picture of his hand with pillsThe actions of the police officers at the time of his death have nothing to do with what was on his cellphoneI feel like watching the trial of George Floyd is making me sadThis is a piece of justice for the death of my sonWe might not be hereThey are going to get himThey are going to get himWas a crime committed?The answer to that question is no, and we will not charge these officers with any criminal liability related to the shooting death or use of force of ClarkOn April 14, 1991, King fought emotional and physical scarsThis is a photo album of my dad\\'s newspaper articles since he\\'s been in the newsThere are years and yearsYou throw someone to the wolves and expect them to be normalThere is no such thing as normal after thatCan you imagine how many of them have never been videotaped?There are a lot of themI would have hoped that Oscar\\'s trial would have been televised because America has to look in the mirror and say, \"Are all people being treated equally?\"There was excessive use of force against George FloydSeveral people witnessed the murder of this manYou can see it with our eyesIt is crazyPeople don\\'t know what it does to your familyIt is bigger than a trial and this officerWe don\\'t get to see them againWe don\\'t get to smell or kiss them againThe prosecutor who delivered the closing argument said that the case was exactly what he thought it would beIt is what you felt in your gutThe defense argued that Mr Floyd had taken drugs and had resisted when officers tried to get him into a carThe lawyer for Mr Chauvin told the jury to look at the totality of the circumstancesThe closing arguments were held on the 18th floor of a government building surrounded by temporary fencing and military sentriesThe fatal police shooting of Daunte Wright was just 10 miles away from the high security area&lt;p&gt;\n",
