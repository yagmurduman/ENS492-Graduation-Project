0,1,&lt;p&gt;The under-35s are bearing the brunt of the jobs crisis&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;According to official figures, younger people continue to bear the brunt of the jobs crisis.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;80% of the 811,000 payroll jobs lost in the UK in the year to March were under the age of 35.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unemployment rate was 4.9% in the three months to February, down from 5% previously.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was despite the fact that most of the UK was locked down.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jobs market remains subdued, with five million people employed but still on the unemployment line, according to the ONS.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, Surenx80 Thiru, said that unemployment will peak at the end of 2021.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The longer-term structural unemployment caused by Covid-19, particularly among young people, may mean that the road back to pre-pandemic levels lags behind the wider economic recovery.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between December and February, 1.67 million people were out of work.That is down from the previous quarter but still higher than a year ago.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The retail and hospitality sectors were hit hard by the crisis, and younger people are suffering disproportionately.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the payroll jobs lost in the year to March were held by people under the age of 35.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of young people in employment has hit a "post-pandemic low" according to Gerwyn Davies.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The urgent case for apprenticeship incentives to be made more generous is reinforced by this.It would be wrong to get carried away with the pleasant surprise of a dip in the official unemployment rate below 5%.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tax data for March shows the true picture of the disease.The fact that the numbers in the first few months have been stable is definitely a source of relief.Thanks to the extension of support schemes, employers were able to navigate the second lockdown without a lot of job losses.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As support is phased out in late summer, there will be strains.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope of a lower peak to unemployment is offered by these figures.The jobs market has been stable in recent months, according to the ONS.The labour market remains subdued but there are positive signs.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recovery still depends on the evolution of the Pandemic, according to an economist.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the government\'s plan to reopen the economy continues, we expect a gradual recovery in the labour market in the coming months.&lt;p&gt;

0,1,&lt;p&gt;The economic outlook is usually uncertain&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The Bank of England said the outlook for the UK economy was "unusually uncertain" despite the rapid roll out of the vaccine programme.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone above the age of 50 will have their first jab by the end of May, followed by everyone by the end of July.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The governor of the Bank of England said last week that he expected the economy to come back at the end of the year.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Office for Budget Responsibility predicts that unemployment will peak at 6.5% instead of the 11.9% predicted last July.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, an official statement on Thursday from the Bank\'s Monetary Policy Committee, which sets interest rates, was more cautious.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outlook for the UK economy, and particularly the relative movement in demand and supply during the recovery from the recession, was unclear.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cross-currents are the same for the Bank of England.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since its previous meeting in February, most developments - notably fresh rounds of fiscal stimuli domestically and abroad - have had positive implications for the economic outlook, but downside risks and uncertainty concerning the evolution of the pandemic are still prominent.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monetary policy committee had no immediate plans to tighten monetary policy.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The committee stands ready to take whatever action is necessary to achieve its objectives if the outlook for inflation weakens.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk of a rate rise is downplayed in today\'s Monetary Policy Report.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is more than one reason for the BoE to do so.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weird things have come to many of our lives.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bank of England is the same.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It insists it doesn\'t engage in monetary financing, where the central bank simply creates money from nothing (once upon a time you could say "prints money" but now it\'s digital) and "lends" it to the government.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What\'s happening now isn\'t much different.According to the Financial Times, almost all of the money being borrowed by the government this financial year will be owed to the Bank of England.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government borrows most of its money from another branch of the public sector.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It gets it back if it pays interest on the debt.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s easy to make money.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The money the BoE creates from nothing is used to buy gilts from big City players, hoping they\'ll invest the cash in productive industry.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BoE reserves pay interest at the official rate.The BoE would be the biggest loser if rates rose.&lt;p&gt;

0,1,&lt;p&gt;It is not an IPOHere is why that is important&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of debate as to whether or not the price will pop when the market opens.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tech listings get a lot of attention, as even those not trying to invest find the initial trade movements compelling entertainment.The initial price movement will not just represent money being made or lost, but it also could shape the digital asset industry narrative for some time to come.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A direct listing is a relatively new option for companies wishing to go public, and one that is suited to acryptocurrencies company.The differences between direct listings and IPOs are material and are causing some confusion in the market, so in the interests of clarifying what the direct listing choice means for Coinbase, here we look at the main differences and how they may affect the initial price movement as well as the company.Investment bankers get paid a percentage of the total amount raised when they set the share price as high as they think the market will bear.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market on the initial trading day influences the starting price in a direct listing.There is a 10-minute period on the day of initial trading in which interested buyers and sellers can enter their offers.This information is used to calculate the current reference price.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it decides yes, the applicable orders that have been entered will be executed at that price.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The direct listing will not fill the coffers with cash, but it will make it easier for the company to raise capital in the future.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IPOs are less volatile in initial trading than direct listings due to three reasons.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Direct listings do away with the promotional costs and much of the consulting fees.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost of an IPO is one of the reasons why companies stay private.A direct listing is a better option for a company that wants to focus more on expansion than on initial share prices.The market sets the initial price rather than a group of investment bankers, which is in line with the open-access and transparent ethos of the project.&lt;p&gt;

0,1,&lt;p&gt;If you buy a car with a digital currency, you will be a lemon&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;A quick look at the fine print suggests that bitcoiners should probably lower their expectations.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could be dangerous for their financial health to pay for a car with something other than dollars.There are laws in the U.S. that protect car buyers from being stuck with vehicles that have manufacturing defects.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any new car owner who buys a lemon has the right to a full refund or buy back.There is a time period for car buyers to exercise their lemon law rights.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Florida, a car buyer has 24 months to make a lemon-law claim.The car seller has the right to try to fix the car.If it can\'t, then the state\'s lemon law is triggered and the owner can ask for all of his or her money back.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is, you are purchasing his promise of a multi-year IOU in his name to repay $50,000 cash when the conditions of your state\'s lemon laws are triggered.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your $50,000 car is a dud and your state has a lemon law, you will be paid back in one.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the time of purchase, it will return the exact amount of bitcoins.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The money will be paid back in U.S. dollars.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The danger is that it has the right to choose which.If the price of bitcoin goes down by 50%, there is a good chance thatTesla will give you $25,000 worth of bitcoins, not a $50,000 check.You will get a full $50,000 back if you buy a car with regular U.S. dollars.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to receive a check for $50,000, you have the right to use a foreign currency.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lemon law protection may be required byTesla buyers given reports of car unreliability.It is not a good policy for a company that wants to be seen as bitcoin friendly to give up a large portion of its lemon law benefits.All the benefits of price rises go to the company, while all the risk of price declines goes to the customer.It\'s "heads I win, tails you lose" A payment is often the first dance move in a long-term relationship between the two parties.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could collapse next week.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its price could go up to $1 million.Over the lifetime of the contract, the various counterparties have to account for all of the risks and rewards.A more equitable way to structure its relationship with its customers might be to allow them to share the upside.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a customer spends $50,000 worth of bitcoins on a car, the company could promise to give them a flat $50,000 back, even if the value of the currency falls.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Musk has said that all payments will be retained as bitcoins, rather than being converted into dollars.This is a big change from other corporate moments, which were just another way for companies to accept money from customers.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The debts to its customers would be denominated in dollars while the reserves would be in the virtual currency.The foreign exchange risk would be costly for the company.Post-split lemon law refunds are not apparent in the terms and conditions of the company.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is the reason that payments in bitcoin are unlikely to take off.The dollar is easy.&lt;p&gt;
0,1,&lt;p&gt;Money can be changed to learn from growth&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;This week, you could be forgiven for thinking that the epicenter of the altcoins is the non-fungible token (NFT).After failing to consolidate gains made by Musk, the price of the digital currency dropped to its lowest level since March 8.NFT stories were all over again.A Beeple art piece sold for $6 million to raise funds for the Open Earth Foundation\'s efforts to fight climate change, and both The New York Times and Time Magazine announced sales of their own NFTs.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were joined by Lucas Llach, a former vice president of the Central Bank of Argentina, and Santiago Siri, an Argentine-born developer who came up with an entirely new approach to democracy.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After you read the newsletter, have a listen to Gary Vaynerchuck talk about the current mania around tokenized digital artifacts and compare it to the 2000 dot com bubble.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that once NFT prices correct to more reasonable levels, it will clear the way for the technology\'s truetransformational phase, like the emergence of life-changing social media and mobile computing innovations in wake of the dot.com bust.The two-step evolution of the internet was similar to the dot.com business model, which was to convince consumers to buy their pet.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem was each site was easily replicable, which made for a brutal competition in which there could be only a few winners.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was an explosion of apps that were built on the iPhone and Android operating systems.The impact, utility and value of the apps and platforms were forged.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interoperability and "composability" are the defining features of the Defi projects that encourage cross-integration with different protocols and applications.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They leverage the value generated by each to grow a wider lending, borrowing and payments platform out of a network of automated market-makers, self-executing collateral systems, trustless price data and stable coins.If NFT projects are to add meaningful value to the creative, they must integrate with other elements of the open-sourced, data-driven economy.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, it just needs to serve the project\'s objective.They were built on a model of utility token where the underlying ecosystems was projected to grow as users exchanged a token with features that were supposed to encourage them to act in the common interest.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As assets to buy and hold in the hope of price appreciation, the token was not something to exchange and use.There was a conflict between user motivation and intended outcomes.When traders in financial products seek to profit from market inefficiencies, their buying or selling behaviors will drive prices back toward equilibrium.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other DeFi lending platforms have offered special rewards to borrowers to entice them to lend to them.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of speculation.NFT proponents talk of democratizing arts and entertainment, empowering up-and-coming artists and independent content creators, and of using this technology to raise money for worthy causes.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In theory, the technology could give creators access to a wider potential market and encourage greater transparency to prevent powerful collectors and galleries from setting prices.It might allow features that automatically deliver some of the secondary market\'s proceeds to the original artist or to designated recipients, but it\'s hard to speak of revolution if most of the value is captured by a few celebrity creators.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with the traditional art market, these high-priced unique assets will likely not find much liquidity in secondary sales by themselves, which means the market itself won\'t grow, which in turn won\'t help lesser-known artists.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer may lie in copying DeFi, but also in joining it.Integrating NFT minting platforms and marketplaces into DeFi\'s network of decentralized exchanges and liquidity engines would allow developers of those projects to tap into

0,1,&lt;p&gt;Can Decentralized Stable Coins Stabilize?&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"Decentralized finance idealists want to create perfectly free financial ecosystems that can't be subverted by governments, corporations or regulators.They want their nirvana to be equipped with stable coins so users can be protected from price craziness.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new wave of stablecoin architects think it is possible that they are unanchored to generate traction.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They want to create money that is stable but also avoids relying on the authorities that underpin the dollar system.A stable money is important to people who participate in financial transactions.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volatile assets do not cut it.The Centre Consortium, consisting of Coinbase and Circle.J.P. Koning, issued a U.S. dollar stable coin called the USD coin.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve, America's central bank, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation are all connected to that bank.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may be necessary for it to carry out know your customer checks.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most radical stablecoin experiments are empty set dollar, dynamic set dollar and basis cash.This trio of stablecoins, deployed on the ether, try to achieve decentralization by doing away with the backing assets that traditional money issuers have always relied on to ensure the stability of the money they issue.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The supply of stable coins gets reduced as more strays are locked away.No-collateral money is a breakthrough idea for decentralization maximalists.Stable coins can be subverted by using Collateral, especially when it is regulated.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their prices were far below their target price as of yesterday. terraUSD appears to be functioning, despite the fact that these experiments don't seem to be working out. terraUSD is the fifth-largest stable coin on CoinGecko and it relies on incentives.When terraUSD falls below $1, traders are given an opportunity to buy terraUSD and quickly convert them into $1 worth of newly created LUNA token.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The traders make a 2-cent profit.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect of sucking up the excess supply of terraUSD is to bring it back to $1. frax uses the same incentive mechanism as terraUSD to maintain its $1 price.There is a layer of reserve in the frax protocol.Over the last few months, frax has succeeded in maintaining a $1 price despite the fact that the remaining 14 million are unbacked.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No-collateral and collateral-lite stable coins are often advertised as technological advances.It is possible that no-collateral money isn't sustainable in the long term.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A black swan market disruption is the biggest threat to a stable asset.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People are afraid.There is a run from riskier stable assets to less-risky ones.Over-collateralization is a centuries-old plan for establishing stable money.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a panic hits and pressure builds on the bank's $1 peg, the bank can always sell this collateral and use the funds to support its peg.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They could be high risk assets that offer only the illusion of safety.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the next big market disruption hits, we will know which one it is."&lt;p&gt;

0,1,&lt;p&gt;If stock-to-flow is correct, there should be less volatility&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The recent price rally confirms that more and more investors are interested in the virtual currency.Since the beginning of the year, the price of the asset has doubled, but financial analysts, econometrician, and value investors are still having a hard time valuing it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to apply quantitative valuation models when there is no interest or cash flow generated.The most controversial attempt was launched by a person going by the name of PlanB.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His model is based on the stock-to-flow ratio.The stock-to-flow ratio is an economic concept and measures the relationship between the existing supply and the annual production of any commodity.PlanB used the model to make statements about future price developments.An adapted version of the stock-to-flow model was published by the financial analyst after he was criticized.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The debate about whether the stock-to-flow model is worth applying to bitcoin is not over.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One is tempted to ask: What predictive power does the stock-to-flow ratio have?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monetary theory, where the stock-to-flow concept originated, is clear on one thing: The ratio measures the hardness and thus suitability of a thing as (commodity) money.The Austrian-American libertarian monetary economist Ludwig von Mises introduced the term "commodity money" in his monumental work "The Theory of Money and Credit."One feels happy about every additional unit of money, while one feels saturated with other goods at some point.The high marketability of money, which is universally exchangeable against all other goods, is the reason for this.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The marginal costs in production are increasing.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more one wants to produce, the more expensive it becomes.It can be assumed that all units of a good ever created are potentially still available due to a high stock-to-flow ratio.The good is unlikely to be consumed or used up, but any stock is potential supply.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no absolute scarcity.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is because scarcity is determined by the relationship between supply and demand, i.e., stocks to flows.Supply and demand are not in equilibrium if there is scarcity.The stock of the commodity isn\'t brought onto the markets for whatever reason.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A high stock-to-flow ratio is a necessary condition for money, but not enough.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A high stock-to-flow ratio is needed for hard money.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ratio doesn\'t say anything about how market participants value the good in question.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high stock-to-flow ratio is indicative of how hard it is to make money.The characteristics of the crypto-asset make it suitable for money.This discovery process may still be far from complete because of the characteristic facts about the coin that are currently making people discover it as money-like.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is impossible for the stock-to-flow model to predict future price developments based on past data points.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past results can\'t be translated into future returns with absolute certainty.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They serve to give investors hope.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In monetary theory, a high stock-to-flow ratio should gradually translate into low volatility.Due to high stocks, the probability is higher, with other conditions remaining the same, that negative supply shocks or positive demand can be offset.Potential supply in the form of stock can leave the hoards at any time and have a stabilizing effect on the price.When supply-side disruption occurs, the stock-to-flow ratio of crude oil is very low.The high stock-to-flow ratio has an effect on the price of gold.&lt;p&gt;

0,1,&lt;p&gt;When DeFi becomes more intelligent&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;\'Decentralized finance\' has captured the hearts and minds of the community in the last few months.DeFi offers a new and transparent playground to automate financial primitives such as lending or market making without the need of intermediaries.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This data can be used by machine intelligence models to better understand and benefit from the behavior of DeFi protocols.While the current generation of DeFi protocols has brought us unprecedented levels of programmability and automation, the next wave will focus on intelligence as a core capability.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence is eating the world and we are on the verge of an intelligent Defi era.Most of the world\'s software is being rewritten with artificial intelligence as a first class citizen.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence is becoming a fundamental building block of modern software applications.The infrastructure that powers business and consumer applications is becoming smarter in nature.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cornerstone of the first generation of successful DeFi protocols has been the automation of financial primitives such as lending or market-making.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That level of programmability and automation has started to push the boundaries of innovation creating vehicles such as flash loans, automated market-makers (AMM) or on-chain insurance that are impossible to even imagine in other capital markets.There is something beautiful, almost seductive, about the simplicity of the x*y*k balance in UniSwap or Compound.The evolution of the market is likely to push us towards more sophisticated DeFi protocols that leverage machine intelligence as a first-class citizen.These types of protocols will enable robust levels of automation, but they will be able to learn and evolve their behavior based on market activity.Imagine a group of DeFi primitives that evolve their behavior based on historical data about the market.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current generation of lending protocols such as Maker, Aave or Compound do not take into account many other factors that can enable robust borrower-lender dynamics.We could imagine DeFi lending protocols that would factor not only collateralization levels but factors such as liquidation history, interactions with other lending protocols and transactional patterns to develop an intelligent and quantitative profile of borrowers and lenders.Think of this trend as an intelligent credit rating system for DeFi protocols.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a world in which the interactions with DeFi protocols are completely transparent, that data footprint can be used to create smarter insurance models.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine a model in which the insurance of specific smart contracts or addresses is based on intelligent models that use quantitative DeFi factors such as the number of liquidations in lending protocols the smart contract has been exposed to or the types of pools specific addresses are supplying.Intelligence can be used in the next generation of Defi protocols to provide a very intelligent profile about specific addresses.At first, the idea of intelligent DeFi protocols might seem like one of those "AI for X" ideas that attempt to insert artificial intelligence into any meaningful software trend in the market.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core building blocks of financial services are being dis-intermediated by DeFi.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rapid evolution of machine learning technologies is making traditional services in capital markets more intelligent.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competing with that level of intelligence requires more than just automation and programmability.The path towards intelligent DeFi protocols is being forged by the frantic evolution of DeFi together with the mainstream adoption of machine learning technologies.The new generation of DeFi protocols won\'t automate only financial primitives, but will evolve their behavior based on market conditions and utilization.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination of these two movements can lead to a new level of innovation in DeFi that powers a brand new generation of intelligent financial services.&lt;p&gt;

0,1,&lt;p&gt;The real world can be brought on-chain by NFTs&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;There has been an unprecedented level of mainstream interest in the technology.Proponents of NFTs claim that they represent a paradigm shift compared to detractors who claim that NFTs are just like the initial coin offering era.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Times referred to NFTs as blockchain-certified computer files.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a previous article, the Times wrote, "NFTs make digital artworks, and therefore sellable."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has been followed by a sudden burst of products coming to market in a bit of a gold rush.For the purposes of this article, we will stick to NFTs as digital collectibles that people love to own, pay for and brag to their friends and strangers about.This is the reason why Pokemon cards and baseball cards are valuable and why NFTs such as Aavegotchis and NBA Top Shot are valuable.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most NFTs are representations of off-chain assets.Many of the challenges associated with off-chain assets are relevant to NFTs.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An NFT can be used to bind or map a unique object, such as a document, image, audio or video file, or a physical object such as a house or a bicycle.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NFTs are not native assets.Beeple\'s painting, "The First 5000 days", is a digital work of art that is not native to the blockchain.Beeple created a non-fungible token for the painting that was made of 5,000 digital works of art in desktop software.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Property rights and ownership are defined by the fact that you control the private key that can send the token to someone else, and you own the token.A JPEG file and its copy both produce the same hash, but with a different function.It is the Beeple token that makes the artwork worth 69 million more than a copy of the digital artwork.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I might own a Beeple artwork on ether, but if Justin Sun mints the Beeple artwork on tron, I will claim ownership of the artwork.A court in the U.S. might enforce MetaKovan\'s rights, whereas a court in Macau might decide in favor of Sun.It depends.In the case of NBA Top Shot, you own a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to use, copy and display the art for personal, non commercial use.When I paid for the digital collectible, did my rights change as a result of that update?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If investors, asset managers, grandma and grandpa lose their Beeples or Top Shots to a double-spend, they will vote, but courts and legislators aren\'t called upon.It\'s the Beeples and Top Shot moments that have accelerated Web 3.0 like nothing before, and that\'s why I\'m excited about NFTs.&lt;p&gt;
0,1,&lt;p&gt;What is the meaning of NFT sales for digital real estate?&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;In New York City, there is a row of tall, skinny, high-rise condominiums along the southern end of Central Park.The average apartment there sells for more than $37 million, several have sold for more than $100 million, and one even sold for $240 million.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost nobody lives in these apartments and they sit unused.Humans are notoriously bad at pricing assets, especially when an asset\'s value is higher than its actual utility.Last week, when Christie\'s sold Beeple\'s digital art for $69 million, naturally people were aghast.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Art\'s value is based on society\'s collective agreement about its value.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The value of art has nothing to do with the cost of materials used to make it or how useful it is, which is why most people cannot accurately price it.Dozens of domain names have sold for a lot of money.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most expensive domain name sale was for carinsurance.com.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a friend recently asked me, "Why would I pay real money for fake land?", I explained that digital real estate is like a combination of N. The marginal cost to produce a digital parcel of land is almost nothing, and its value is more closely related to its perceived scarcity than to its actual utility.Some might say the prices are too high.Some of the busiest streets in the world, including New York\'s Madison Avenue and Broadway and London\'s Oxford Street, are filled with empty storefronts.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real-world companies have followed online shoppers.Their next stop is the metaverse, where their customers are socializing and window-shopping, and now even buying real-world items.Spending in virtual world environments is nothing new.People have been buying extra lives in video games for a long time.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies are realizing that virtual events like these can be much more cost-effective than real-world ones.Imagine the possibilities if instead of Nike having a store on every Main Street in America it built one jaw-dropping virtual retail experience in a metaverse that could sell to quite literally anyone anywhere At some point, every company will realize it needs virtual stores in a metaverse like Decentraland, just as they have all learned they must all have a website on the internet.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the content inside the metaverses becomes more compelling, more people will show up, thus attracting more corporate sponsorships.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At $31,000 per square foot, this sale broke records, and people at the time felt the price made no sense.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Beeple sale has shown us that a legitimizing force like Christie\'s can attract real-world wealth in enormous amounts.As real-world companies set up shop in virtual worlds, they will drive up property values around them and foster investment in new, community-building projects, building a new and valuable digital real estate ecosystem with credible players and significant price tags.Some digital NBA TopShot cards that sold for $9 a pack in November have since gone for $200,000 each, so we have established why digital real estate might have a value, but why do It is the same reason why digital art and digital basketball cards are selling for more than their real world equivalents.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital real estate is now seen as valuable, but its transferability will catapult its value beyond any perceived utility or scarcity value.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prices of NFTs and digital real estate today are small compared to what they may be worth in the future, once the rest of the world catches on.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best parcels of virtual real estate will appreciate faster than real-world real estate.&lt;p&gt;
0,1,&lt;p&gt;The $80 million deal went wrong&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The $80 million deal between the Defi project and the investment firm fell apart on Monday, with both projects pointing fingers and wagging their chins.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two projects in which Alameda is heavily invested, and Reef had offered a 20% discount on the token.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A behind-the-scenes glimpse at an over-the-counter deal between one of the cryptocurrencies was shown during the conflict.We didn\'t understand why Alameda, our long-term strategic investor, would sell their token immediately after purchase to Binance.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An immediate token flip was definitely not what was supposed to happen, according to Reef CEO Denko Mancheski.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alameda says there wasn\'t an agreed-upon period.Legal threats are mounting now that the whole situation is public.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to public documents, Alameda agreed to purchase an estimated $80 million worth of REEF token on March 8.Both sides dispute if the second transaction was ever supposed to occur under the verbal agreements made prior to the first transaction.Reefreneged on the OTC trade and went to the press to brag over the initial transaction.Alameda knew in advance about the press release and agreed to take the rest of the token under a counter offer from Mancheski.When Mancheski declined moving funds to Alameda, the dispute went public.&lt;p&gt;

"EVERYDAYS: THE first 5000 days" at Christies.This and other wild deals underscore a larger issue in the global economy, which is how many excess dollars are sloshing around in search of finite things to buy.Global economic forces are likely to ensure that fund flow continues for some time, as we discuss in this week\'s essay.In the third part of our series on the topic, we talk to Roham, the CEO and founder of Dapper Labs.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During last week\'s Wall Street Journal Job Summit, Fed Chair Powell amplified speculation when he gave no word of deliberate actions to curb the tightening market conditions.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Powell and the Fed wouldn\'t put their money where their mouth is, the European Central Bank did.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news that the European Central Bank would accelerate its bond-buying program sent the S&P 500 into record territory.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start of the COVID-19 crisis, half of all cross-border loans and international debt securities were denominated in dollars.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Bank of International Settlements, non-U.S. banks had a record $12.4 trillion in dollar liabilities by the third quarter of last year.Dollarization increases the influence of U.S. policymaking on European financial conditions and decreases the domestic economy.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As yields rose in the U.S., eurozone borrowing costs also went up, even though the European Union was worse off than the U.S. This latest move has the potential to send an opposite ripple effect across the Atlantic, via the euro-dollar exchange rate.The dilemma for Powell and his colleagues is that the Fed might need to signal tighter monetary policy at some point.That would raise U.S. bond yields and widen the premium over newly lowered eurozone yields, which would then drive even more European money into dollars and increase the greenback\'s value versus the euro.U.S. products would become more expensive for Europeans and European exports to the U.S. would be cheaper in dollar terms.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you won\'t hear it from the Fed, it will be concerned about the economic effects of a strong dollar.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign exchange markets, where the dollar weakened on Thursday, seem to know that.The standard response is for the currency to fall.The euro was not the cause of the dollar heading south.The Fed now has less room to change its current, easy-money course because the restored buoyancy in stock markets pushed investors into riskier bets.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short-term rates around the world have been driven down by their bond-buying.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All risk assets have been pushed higher with unprecedented cross-market correlation as a result of filling financial institutions balance sheets with monetary reserves.Because of investors\' hyper-sensitivity to even the most subtle changes in policy, central banks\' hands are tied.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central banks put their monetary machines into top speed when there is a signal that the Fed is considering scaling back quantitative easing.The default is for more of the same because they can\'t slow them down.A relentless increase in money supply, coupled with persistent increases in the prices of assets controlled by hedge funds and few other privileged investors but not by the general public, is a recipe for distrust.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The charts below were used to praise the Great Moderation, an almost two-decade period of resounding success for central banks.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed Chair Paul Volcker imposed high interest rates in the early 1980s which allowed benchmark short-term rates to decline.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the crisis, rates have leveled off, but the falling cost of credit unlocked capital for the world.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are at zero, with nowhere else to go.In Switzerland, Japan and most recently the eurozone, there is a wacky situation in which lenders pay borrowers for the right to lend them money.The central banks adopted Japan\'s approach to quantitative easing as they sought to boost lending during the crisis.In order to drive down long-term bond yields, central banks buy bonds and other assets from commercial banks.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When there is a signal that QE might be ending, investors don\'t buy everything.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There wasn\'t any nuance.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chart is a representation of the dilemma described in the column.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was inevitable that the central bankers who brought us the Great Moderation would run out of money.The NFT phenomenon has hit a backlash after weeks of big-money headlines and celebrity endorsements.They are a waste of energy and a symbol of greed and wanton destruction.One of the positives of the NFT phenomenon is that it is pushing the discussion of cryptocurrencies into the mainstream.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an opinion piece, Cove Markets head of marketing Thomas Meyer said,

that he doesn\'t plan to go public, he also thinks that the company should be valued much higher than $100 billion.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The value of cryptocurrencies depends less on their utility and more on how well each one appeals to a large enough community to gain network effects.&lt;p&gt;
0,1,&lt;p&gt;Bananas and Mortgages can explain the NFT craze&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;One way to make sense of the phenomenon is to keep in mind that a thing can be split into two things.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before and after the split, the value of each thing is in the eye of the beholder.The value of the fruit is obvious.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The peel can be used as compost in the garden.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banana peels can be used for prank tricks, such as leaving one on the floor for someone to slip on or stuffing one into a car\'s tailpipe.There was a brief fad of smoking banana peels in the 1960s.There is a point that the value of a banana, and of its peel, is subjective, but who is to say that those kids didn\'t feel some kind of high?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you financed a home with a mortgage, chances are the institution where you send your monthly payment is not the same one that holds the mortgage.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mortgage is an asset that can be split into parts and sold separately to different entities.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The debt is similar to the part of the banana that is eaten.It gets packaged with a whole bunch of other naked bananas into the complex securities you heard about in The Big Short.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your lender may or may not farm out this set of administrative duties after the loan closes.A servicer manages billing and payments, pays property taxes and hazard insurance on your behalf, writes a nasty letter if you pay late and does other scutwork.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you can eat the banana and keep the skin, when a loan is paid off, it disappears.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investor believes that the debt has value because the holder is entitled to your monthly principal and interest payments over the life of the debt.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the buyer of the peel, servicing rights have value because the servicer earns a fee for its work.Both the mortgage and servicing rights generate income for their owners.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on the outlook for interest rates, home prices, employment levels and probably lots of other things, the answer depends on how likely you are to stay in the home.Wall Street has long employed armies of highly paid propellerheads who crunch numbers to estimate the "prepayment speed" of mortgage assets.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody knows what will happen until it happens, but forecasts are right or wrong in retrospect.One asset can become two, and the value of each is subjective.According to anexplanation in Vogue, the banana was replaced in the artist\'s instructions for recreating the work.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One reason is that you really appreciate the work and want to patronizing the artist, because you believe it makes an important statement about something.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other is for you to impress your friends at the next cocktail party.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The title of the banana masterpiece was "Comedian."Digital items can create bragging rights just like their canvas-based counterparts, and are arguably more liquid as an asset class.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can represent things like real estate and real-world assets.If you sell a tweet, it will be visible to all.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the player only signs one, the card that has the most value will be the one you print.You might think $1 million for a piece of cardboard is a lot.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is a small change.A mystery buyer paid $69.5 million for an NFT by the artist known as Beeple, who was ready to pay $60 million.They didn\'t have to pay a dime if they just wanted to appreciate the work.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn\'t confer the same advantage as displaying a painting in your den because it\'s a purely digital work.In the case of virtual objects that no one can solely possess, NFTs have preserved or resurrected the bragging rights.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brady Dale reported that there are now finance markets where you can pledge NFTs as security for loans.Positive side effects have been shown by the NFT phenomenon.Beeple can pursue his art without having to worry about putting food on the table.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like financial markets, the art markets are known to crash.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is hard to imagine that a piece of art can not be hung on a wall.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should be prepared to savor those rights for a long time.It may sound crazy to pay almost $70 million to own a picture anyone can look at for free.The time is right to sell NFTs.&lt;p&gt;

funerals are taking place in car parks.In the northern state of Rajasthan, Rajesh Soni took his father from one hospital to another in a tuk-tuk for eight hours.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 5pm, he decided to stop looking for a hospital bed because his father's condition was getting worse.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am giving him medicine at home, but I am not sure if he will survive.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were left to die on the streets.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several private hospitalsconned him and took money to do tests, only to tell him later to take his father away as there were no beds.I spent the money on the tuk-tuk driver and hospitals.Such stories have become common in Delhi, the worst affected city in India, but similar accounts are now coming in from smaller cities and towns across the country.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up to 7 April, it was taking 72 days for the number of cases to double, but now it is 27 days.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a senior journalist in the city, hospitals were overrun and this suggests that the actual numbers are much higher.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students from all over the country take exams to get into prestigious medical and engineering colleges in the district.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The district is in turmoil now that the students have left, and it is largely away from the attention of national and international media.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The journalist said that the city's hospitals were not ready for a Covid wave.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said there was an urgent need to add more oxygen and ICU beds before more people die on the streets.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, 32% of the deaths in the city happened.There is no official data on healthcare facilities in the city, but several people who spoke to the BBC said they had been unable to find a bed for their loved ones.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A senior journalist in the city said the death toll was much higher as cremation and burial grounds were open all the time.Yogi Adityanath, the state's chief minister, recently said there was no shortage of drugs, hospital beds or oxygen, but experts say the reality on the ground is vastly different.Social media is awash with posts from people from the state pleading for beds, oxygen and drugs like rem An employee of one small private hospital told the BBC that arranging oxygen had become difficult, but he would not complain because he feared retribution.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't understand why a hospital would report a shortage.He said it makes no sense. hish Yadav's father is in a critical condition in a hospital in Kanpur district but he is unable to get a bed and he doesn't have access to a doctor.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were no Covid-19 cases in the central Indian district on 1 March.In the past seven days, it has added more than 3000 cases.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no trained doctors to operate the life-support machines in the district hospital.The district hospital should have 49 specialist doctors, but it only has seven.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a shortage of nurses and lab technicians.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local journalists say that the district is not able to handle really sick patients as it did not prepare for the surge in cases.Several people have died in the district without getting proper treatment.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has recorded a 26% increase in its caseload since 20 April, and a 33% increase in deaths in the same period.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than half of the hospital's oxygen beds were occupied.A senior official from the hospital said that out of 220 doctors, 40 had tested positive in the past 10 days and four of them had died.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pressure on the hospital has been increased by this.The west of the state is badly hit.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to official data, it has recorded more than 5,000 cases since April 5.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior journalists in the state say that testing is a major problem in smaller towns and cities.Many people die without ever being tested for Covid-19.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deaths don't go into official data.The test was not done in Aurangabad.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She couldn't get a test done as her condition continued to get worse.Hospitals wouldn't admit her without a positive test result.Her family took her to a small private hospital in a nearby district where she tested positive, but the hospital said she was critical and they didn't have facilities to treat her.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tourist district in the Himalayas is struggling to cope with the rising number of cases.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 4,000 cases and 82 deaths have been reported in the past week, and at least 131 of its 142 intensive care beds were occupied on 27 April.It is difficult for the district to handle the rise because it also receives patients from remote towns and villages.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor said the situation was dire and he was terrified.The government didn't plan on augmenting facilities in remote areas.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people in remote Himalayan areas will die and we won't hear about it.They won't show up in statistics."&lt;p&gt;

0,2,&lt;p&gt;One dose of vaccine halves transmission&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;A single dose of a coronaviruses vaccine can reduce household transmission of the virus by up to half, according to a study.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only do vaccines reduce the severity of illness and prevent hundreds of deaths every day, we now see they also have an additional impact on reducing the chance of passing Covid-19 on to others.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar results could be expected in other settings with similar transmission risks, such as shared accommodation and prisons.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public Health England said it would expect the same results in other high-risk settings.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccination campaign is making good progress into younger age groups, which is good news for the continued easing of restrictions.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cause for concern, though, is whether newer versions of the virus, which might be more resistant to vaccines, might cause a new surge in infections.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expert opinion is that the current vaccines will provide a significant degree of protection, especially against severe illness.Most of the people in the study were under the age of 60.&lt;p&gt;

0,2,&lt;p&gt;The new president challenges the denial&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;President Samia Suluhu Hassan is more conciliatory than her predecessor, who was autocratic.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been following the debate, and I must say it is not healthy for our nation," she told MPs a month after she was sworn in.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The very first time she stood on stage as president, her aura, choice of words and demeanor promised a completely different type of leadership.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is making bold announcements, which is something that has not been experienced since the arrival of the bulldozer, said Deodatus Balile, managing editor of Jamhuri Media.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has a different approach to Covid-19.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The global warnings over coronaviruses were downplayed by Magufuli, who refused to allow Covid-19 vaccines into the country.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no reliable statistics on infections or deaths from the virus in the country as the government stopped releasing them in May last year.Within three weeks of taking office, she formed a committee of experts to advise her on how to keep people safe.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She wore a face mask on her visit to Uganda, but it was not in her home country of Tanzania.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s true that no new policies have emerged from the expert committee, with new versions of the disease being reported across the globe.People are waiting to find out if she would consider curfews and lock downs as a way to contain the virus, which her predecessor rejected.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such measures would affect millions of poorer Tanzanians, including informal traders who are the support base of the ruling party - Chama Cha Mapind President Samia would need to bring out her qualities of persuasion if she were to go down that path.The president ordered the information ministry to reverse previous decisions saying the government should not give people a chance to say that we are limiting press freedom.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is expected that President Samia will take a less aggressive stance towards international companies in the country.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A subsidiary of a Canadian company was hit with a massive tax bill over royalties the government said it owed.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill was reduced as part of a settlement with the government, which included sharing future economic benefits more equitably.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Samia is due on Tuesday to make her second international trip, this time to Kenya, in her seven weeks in power."I am certain that the new president will be more outward facing and will put the country back on the global map," he says.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Samia\'s approach to leading the country is not about tarnishing her predecessor\'s reputation but rather aboutchoosing.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;"Blood clot have been reported with all Covid-19 vaccinesThe author says they're wrong"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The study didn\'t show that, according to the lead author.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study of Moderna and Pfizer\'s vaccines did not find anyone with blood clot.There were no scary things happening with Johnson & Johnson.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the more than 7 million people who have received the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine, at least seven have experienced very rare blood clot in the brain -- one man during clinical trials and six women during the vaccine\'s roll out.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson & Johnson is coming under fire for stoking fear about Pfizer and Moderna\'s vaccines when in fact Johnson & Johnson\'s shot is the only one authorized in the US with reports of blood clot.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small number of people who received the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine developed low platelet levels as a result of the study by Lee and her colleagues.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That is a really irresponsible thing to say," said Dr. Paul Offit, referring to the J&J media statement.Offit, a vaccine expert at the University of Pennsylvania, is a member of the FDA advisory panel that reviewed emergency use authorization applications from all three Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A member of the vaccine advisory panel to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. William Schaffner said that he thinks Paul is right.His indignation is appropriate.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an email to CNN, a J&J spokesman did not directly respond to questions about why the company had said there had been reports of blood clot.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNN pointed out some issues in the J&J media statement.The company did not repeat the claim that there had been reports of blood clot with all vaccines.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue of blood clot and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine first arose on April 9 when the European Medicines Agency issued a statement that it was investigating reports of blood clot among people who had received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J&J issued a media statement saying that they are aware that there have been reports of thromboembolic events with all COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Thromboembolic events" is a medical term for blood clot.Lee and her colleagues looked at some adverse events reported after people received the Covid-19 vaccines manufactured by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study looked at reports of people with low blood platelet levels, not blood clot reports.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are completely different entities," said Lee, the study\'s lead author.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s like apples and oranges.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pfizer or Moderna vaccine caused 17 people to experience low blood platelet levels for the first time.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reports were not surprising, given that tens of millions of people had received the vaccine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 30 million people in the US have received at least the first dose of either Pfizer or Moderna\'s vaccine, according to the CDC.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many causes for low platelet counts, including pregnant women, heavy alcohol consumption, and viral infections.It has been linked to very small numbers of rare blood clot.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a link to a study in the Johnson & Johnson April 9 media statement.There was no increased incidence of certain types of blood clotting disorders among people who had received Pfizer or Moderna.According to the Wall Street Journal, Johnson & Johnson sought help from Pfizer and Moderna to look into reports of blood clot, but both companies declined, saying their vaccines appeared to be safe.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company issued a statement to CNN saying that they believe collaborative scientific exchange can lead to more robust answers to questions, particularly as it relates to the safety of patients.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;The US surgeon general wants everyone in the country to get the vaccine&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The vaccine is the most important way to end the epidemic.The US Surgeon General said Monday that everyone in the country needs to bevaccinated.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing we have to do is get the vaccine.Turn around and ask our family and friends if they\'re going to get vaccinations.If they need help, we have to help them.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 200 million doses have been administered in the US, with an average of 3 million shots per day, according to the CDC.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hesitancy slows down the vaccine leg.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highly contagious B.1.1.7 variant, first spotted in the UK, has been reported in all 50 US states, according to the CDC.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If young adults don\'t do their part, the Pandemic could drag on indefinitely, health experts say.A big part of the country\'s 65+ population, which got priority access to vaccine before younger Americans, has already been vaccinations.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift in Covid-19 cases is down to a younger and younger age group.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have to start getting serious about this," she said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the increase in Covid-19 cases and emergency room visits in the US are for younger adults, according to the CDC Director.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hospitals in Michigan are filling up with younger patients in the middle of a violent surge."It really is presenting in all of our ERs and frankly in our inpatient units," John Fox said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US waits for a decision on the J&J shot while doctors await word on the vaccine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC and the US Food and Drug Administration recommended pausing the Johnson & Johnson vaccine last week after six reported cases of a "rare and severe" type of blood clot, among more than 7.9 million Americans who took the single-dose vaccine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emergent BioSolutions was asked by the FDA to stop manufacturing the J&J vaccine at a plant.The vaccine advisers to the CDC will meet Friday to discuss whether the J&J vaccine may have caused blood clot, and if so, what to do about it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he expects a decision soon.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope we don\'t see anything after Friday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to get Friday some decision, one way or the other, so experts can gather all the necessary data to help inform their decision."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were the same as the J&J vaccine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 76 million Americans have been fully vaccined with the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines, and there have been no known cases of blood clot linked to either vaccine.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;There is a possible link between blood clot and Covid-19 vaccines&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Even though the link is not yet firm, they\'re calling the condition vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia or VITT.It is characterized by a low number of blood-clotting cells called platelets.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration are checking to see if the vaccine is linked to dangerous clot and hemorrhaging.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA and CDC have asked for a pause in giving out the J&J vaccine while they investigate.The findings support a theory that an immune reaction might underlie the rare blood clot, but the findings don\'t yet explain it.A reaction by the immune system with platelets is what may be going on.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might not be happening more often in recently vaccined people than in the general population.The symptoms developed more than five days after the first vaccine dose.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there have been a few reports of patients with symptoms consistent with this clinical syndrome after the receipt of other vaccines, none have yet been confirmed to fulfill the diagnostic criteria.Most of the patients included in the reports were women younger than 50 years of age, some of whom were receiving estrogen-replacement therapy or oral contraceptives.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some European countries have restricted who can get the vaccine.For example.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People under the age of 55 are not allowed to use it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other countries have stopped using it.CDC\'s vaccine advisers have been asked to consider whether similar restrictions might be appropriate for Johnson & Johnson\'s vaccine, although only a handful of cases have been reported in the US.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition is called VITT.ASH and it says that normal post-vaccine symptoms are not of concern."Patients with severe, recurrent, or persistent symptoms, particularly intense headaches, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, vision changes, shortness of breath, and/or leg pain and swelling, should be evaluated by a medical provider and consideration given."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kevin Ault, professor and division director with the University of Kansas Medical Center, told CNN that more data is needed.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So we\'re going to shake the trees in the databases that the CDC has and we also need to know what the denominator is -- is it just young women or the whole population that\'s been vaccine?"CDC wants to know if there is anything specific that might put people at risk "We\'ve seen these reactions within two weeks, so it doesn\'t sound like a very long time, but we\'ll have a fair amount of data in just those nine or ten days."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is insufficient evidence to establish a relationship between these events and the Ad 26.COV2.S vaccine.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;"The CDC says to watch for these rare symptoms if you've recently had the J&J vaccine"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;If you have a throbbing head that doesn\'t go away, abdominal or leg pain that doesn\'t go away, or breathing problems that get worse, health officials want you to call your doctor immediately.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cases prompted the CDC and the US Food and Drug Administration to recommend that administration of the J&J Covid-19 vaccine be paused to allow for further investigation.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious said that it allows the US Food and Drug Administration and CDC to further investigate these cases to try and understand some of the mechanisms of what it is.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A vaccine safety lead with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that headaches were the initial presenting feature for five of the six women.Of the remaining patients, two are in intensive care, one is still hospitalized and two have been discharged.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What should you do if you recently had the J&J vaccine?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Del Rio said he would immediately notify his health care provider if he developed symptoms after having the vaccine.It\'s not pain that gets better by itself, said Crowther, who chairs the department of medicine at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crowther said that it\'s not the kind of thing that you wait until your physician\'s office opens on Monday before you deal with it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CVST has been known about for a long time, and there are many conditions in which you could see it," Crowther said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meningitis is a disease that affects the brain.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear if the J&J vaccine was responsible for these six cases, Crowther said, and the clot are extremely rare.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clot in six women in the US occurred in combination with a condition in which people have a low blood count of platelets.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crowther said that physicians wouldn\'t see a lot of cases ofCVST in their career.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have some highly effective treatments for this so the problem is getting physicians to recognize this rare problem and treat it appropriately."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC is working on "aggressive" outreach to clinicians so they are aware of the possible risks and how to identify symptoms and treat the condition properly, health officials said Crowther stressed that it doesn\'t mean that vaccines always cause this phenomenon.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people have lower platelet counts and don\'t realize it, so when they get any vaccine and are later diagnosed with thrombocytopenia it may be attributed to the vaccine "even though they may have had it for 10 years and just never known about it."&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;The CDC has new guidance for people who are fully vaccine free&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;When dining outside with friends from multiple households, fully-vaccinated people can now reveal.The CDC is telling unvaccinated people that they still need to wear a mask at such gatherings.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the federal health agency, even if you\'ve been shot, you should avoid large indoor gatherings.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC didn\'t say how many people would be in a large gathering, but it did say that large gatherings bring together many people from multiple households in a private or public space.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In crowded outdoor settings, such as packed stadiums and concerts, where there is decreased ability to maintain physical distance and where many unvaccinated people may also be present, we recommend masking.Until widespread vaccination is achieved, we will continue to recommend this.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two weeks after the second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines, people are considered fully vaccine free by the CDC.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Biden used the new mask guidance from the CDC as an opportunity to urge all Americans to get vaccine.For people who haven\'t gotten their vaccine yet, it\'s another reason to get it.As long as you get the vaccine, we\'re back to that place.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It\'s never been easier," he said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walensky said on Tuesday that the CDC was motivated to update its guidance for fully-vaccinated people after seeing a rise in the number of people.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That, along with the fact that we now have 37% of people over the age of 18 fully vaccined and the fact that our case rates are starting to come down, motivated our change in guidance," Walensky said.As more people get vaccinations, we will come up with more updates.The CDC is able to make this announcement because our scientists are convinced by the data that the odds of getting or giving the virus to others is very, very low.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNN\'s Kaitlan Collins asked during the White House virtual briefing, "What we\'re saying is, states that have mask requirements outdoors, if people are vaccine free, we no longer feel that the vaccine people need masks outdoors, so to the extent that those are consistent."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We worry about protecting the unvaccinated people when we have those densities.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;"Trump's advisers want him to make a PSA to get people to get the Covid-19 vaccine"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The officials emphasized that vaccine hesitancy among Republicans could threaten herd immunity and Trump\'s followers will listen to him.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are still a lot of people who aren\'t sure if he understands that he\'s the only one who can fix this.I don\'t think they\'re going to listen to anyone else, because they have said to me that they want to hear from the president.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person close to Trump disagreed that he should take this approach.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He should not be pushing these vaccines.The person said that Trump\'s posse isn\'t exactly vaccine-approving and it could backfire.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, former President Barack Obama made a video with retired basketball stars.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A senior Trump adviser said that Trump wasn\'t asked to participate in the PSA.According to a person close to the project, the team that organized the PSA did not view it as likely that the 45th president would participate, leaving little opening for his inclusion.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview with Fox, Trump encouraged them to take it.I do," referring to his supporters.However, Trump has actually spoken up only a few times to encourage vaccination.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then last week, he advocated for the vaccine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have our freedom, nobody should be forced.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty-four percent of Republicans are hesitant to get a Covid-19 vaccine, according to a March survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation.Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Tennessee, Wyoming, West Virginia, Georgia, Idaho, Arkansas and South Carolina are the bottom 10 states in this metric.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were concerns last summer that too many Republicans would say no to the vaccine, according to a third former Trump official.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On Facebook, I saw a lot of hesitancy for that group, and we knew it was going to get worse," the official said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His stepping out, because he\'s so connected to the president, is going to be very helpful.The assistant secretary for public affairs at the US Department of Health and Human Services met with Trump in April after being diagnosed with throat cancer.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He left his post after apologizing for a rant he made against career government scientists, in which he accused them of sedition and working to undermine Trump.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we don\'t move half those people into the vaccine column, we\'re most likely not going to reach community immunity, and if we don\'t reach it, the president\'s vaccine legacy is dead."The other senior official said that Trump supporters would respond well to the fact that the former president and the former first lady were both vaccine free.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He could use his language with his supporters to talk about how vaccinations are the way to get the country back to where it needs to be economically and socially.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source said that it would be powerful.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;"The FDA added a safety warning after the CDC lifted a pause on using J&J's coronaviruses vaccine"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The agencies acted quickly after a vote by the CDC\'s Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices recommended lifting the pause.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have questions about which vaccine is right for you, talk to your health care provider.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC Director signed on to the ACIP\'s recommendation that the Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccine be used for people 18 years of age or older in the United States.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They agreed that having a one-shot vaccine that doesn\'t need to be stored in freezers was valuable and would be preferred by many people who do not want to come back for a second dose, or who would struggle to make two vaccine appointments.The agency searched and found 15 likely cases of a rare blood clot condition called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, with three deaths among people who got the vaccine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate of events was 1.9 cases per million people.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 7 cases per million for women 18 to 49 years old.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate is higher for women over 50.There were no cases among men.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The J&J vaccine could prevent over 650 hospitalizations and 12 deaths among women aged 18 to 49 if it were available across the country.The ACIP agreed, voting 10 in favor of lifting the pause, four opposed, with one abstention.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA updated fact sheets accompanying the vaccine, indicating that women under the age of 50 can get the vaccine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA\'s Dr. Peter Marks said new copies of the fact sheets can be printed out to give people at vaccination sites immediately.There are 15 US cases of rare blood clot associated with the J& and four members voted against the recommendation.ACIP discussed the need to give women in this age group an extra warning, but in the end left it out of the vote."And I think we have a responsibility to be certain that they know this, and if they choose to bevaccinated with this anyhow, we want to respect that choice."Goldman said that many of his patients prefer the vaccine for a single dose because they can\'t take off from work.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment includes using blood thinners, but not heparin, as well as an immune product called IVIG to regulate the antibody response.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that the CDC took into account deaths from coronaviruses and the likelihood that people would get vaccine more quickly if it was in the mix.600 to 1,400 deaths from Covid-19 would be prevented, and as many as 3,500 admissions would be prevented.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 40 and 250 Covid-19 deaths would be prevented and as many as 1,000 people would not need treatment if the vaccine were restricted to people over the age of 50.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul Offit, who is a vaccine adviser to the FDA and a pediatrician at Children\'s Hospital of Philadelphia, said he thought the CDC did a good job of laying out the risks of the vaccine.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;Blood banks worry about a US blood shortage&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Many are moving away from collecting blood and instead looking for volunteers who want to donate.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With vaccinations up and case counts down, doctors are administering less convalescent plasma, as numerous clinical trials found the treatment does not significantly lower Covid-19 mortality or shorten hospital stays.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emergency authorization of the US Food and Drug Administration was changed in February.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood banks now face a blood shortage, which is expected to only be alleviated by the fact that there is a year-long shelf life for blood.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For many blood centers, if not all blood centers around the country right now, we\'re seeing less than two days supply of certain blood types."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bloodworks Northwest, which serves 100 southeast hospitals, and LifeSouth, which serves 100 south hospitals, no longer have to test donors for antibodies to treat patients with Covid-19.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chief medical officer of LifeStream, a blood bank that serves 80 hospitals in southern California, said that the testing program is winding down.In August, the FDA gave the intial emergency authorization to treat hospitalized patients with it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can\'t possibly thank the donors enough because the product didn\'t have as much impact as we had hoped.During a major surge of Covid-19 cases in and around Los Angeles this winter, his blood bank was providing area hospitals with 75 units of convalescent plasma each day.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He estimated that demand is down to about one unit per day.There is less incentive to renew them if there is no promising data.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medical community is losing interest in it because of the doubts cast by the science.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The co-chief medical officer at Bloodworks Northwest said that all of those things interact and lead to a decision.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If the science was telling us this was really useful, and nobody paid for it, we would still do it."The treatment hasn\'t been measuring up in the studies so far, but it\'s still important to keep an open mind that it can provide at least some benefit for certain people at a certain point.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the same way that monoclonal antibodies are effective early in the disease course, one would assume that plasma would be more helpful if given earlier," Fajgenbaum said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some patients do respond to convalescent plasma, immunity benefits do not extend to patients receiving other blood products such as platelets or red blood cells, he explained.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fajgenbaum said that there is no good home for the disease in the blood.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus is hard to detect in the blood of people with Covid-19.When it was detected, it was not transmissible.The American Red Cross noted in an April 13 statement that donor turnout had fallen to its lowest level.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bloodworks Northwest is only able to meet 85% of demand from hospitals in its region, according to the organization.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood drives hosted by schools, workplaces, and churches are on hold as in-person interaction in many areas hasn\'t yet resumed.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lack of blood isn\'t enough to meet demand as more patients return to hospitals for procedures that were postponed earlier in the Pandemic.More than 1,000 blood drives around the country are canceled each week as a result of the Pandemic, the Red Cross says.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That\'s partly due to patients and hospitals playing catchup on elected procedures that were delayed earlier in the Pandemic when more hospital beds were occupied with Co It could be related to people coming out of isolation.One in seven patients who end up in the hospital need blood transfusions.Blood can\'t be manufactured, and the only way for hospitals to get enough of it is for people to roll up their sleeves.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help bolster the US blood supply, you can download the American Red Cross blood donor app, visit redcrossblood.org or call 1-800-RED-CROSS.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The zip code finder made by America\'s Blood Centers can be used to find your nearest donation center.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;There were only 2 infections that broke through among hundreds of fully vaccineed people&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;According to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, two of the 417 Rockefeller University employees who had the Pfizer or Moderna shots had breakthrough infections.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The importance of the urgent efforts being taken at the federal and state levels to vaccine the U.S. population is not undermined by these observations.The researchers from Rockefeller University found that coronaviruses with several differences from the original virus caused the breakthrough infections.E484K may be able to escape some of the antibodies produced by coronaviruses.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She tested positive for Covid-19 on March 10 after developing symptoms.A healthy 65-year-old woman received her second dose of the Pfizer vaccine on February 9.She learned that her partner had tested positive for Covid-19.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She tested positive for Covid-19.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is needed to determine whether similar findings related to breakthrough infections or variant would emerge among a larger group of participants from various parts of the United States.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told CNN last week that they have received less than 6,000 reports of breakthrough coronaviruses infections among more than 84 million people fully vaccined.More than 40% of breakthrough cases were in people 60 or older, according to the CDC.They were more prevalent in females.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;The deaths of coronaviruses are down in the US&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The United States has reached the lowest seven-day average of new deaths reported since last July, according to a CNN analysis.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average number of new Covid-19 deaths dropped from 3,431 a day in January to 684 in April.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last time the seven-day average of newly reported deaths fell below 700 was in October.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though the seven-day average of new Covid-19 deaths nationwide has fallen, Adalja said that it will take more time.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cases would fall but deaths would still be high and then deaths would start to fall two weeks later.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you go to a nursing home and give the vaccine to everyone, it will take a while for them to be fully protected.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you want to see the full impact of the vaccines, you want it to be two weeks after the final dose of whatever vaccine they\'re getting."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, the United States officially crossed the 100 million mark of people fully vaccined.More than 140 million people have received at least one dose of vaccine, and more than 101 million people have been fully immunized, according to data from the CDC.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hospitalization and death rate are going to go down as more and more people get vaccinations.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We\'re not halfway through yet, but we\'re going to dig out of this thing and it\'s going to take vaccinations and early treatment," said Murphy."How we\'re going to control the pandemic are diagnostics, treatments, vaccinations and mitigation."&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;17 cases of blood clot condition are reported by the CDC&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;According to the report published on Friday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the safety profile of the vaccine so far has been similar to what was seen in clinical trials, but safety monitoring during the vaccine\'s roll out quickly identified the blood clot incidents.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Monitoring for common and rare adverse events after receipt of all COVID-19 vaccines, including the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, is continuing."Emergency use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was authorized in the United States in February.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine was paused in mid-April due to reports of extremely rare yet severe blood clot events in the brain after vaccinations.The CDC report summarizes the latest safety data on the vaccine, which includes 13,725 incidents reported through the agency\'s Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System.The data shows that 97 percent of the events have been non serious.CDC researchers wrote that, after preliminary reviews, "no other deaths appear to have an association with vaccination."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Half of the reported events occurred in women.The events happened on the first day of the shot.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with a fear of needles may be more likely to get the Covid-19 vaccine over the two-dose option.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with a history of needle aversion are more likely to have a case of fainting associated with injections.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human papillomaviruses vaccine is mostly given to young people.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine rate is 7.8 per 100,000.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracking anxiety event rates will be important information for health care providers as the Covid-19 vaccine reaches more and more young people.It is important that vaccination providers are aware that anxiety-related adverse events can occur after any vaccine, and that they should observe all vaccine recipients for any adverse reactions.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Younger people are more likely to have anxiety-related events after receiving a vaccine than older people.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;"Don't look at the light at the end of the tunnel"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"Despite hope in the United States, where the situation is likely to be much better by summer and at the new normal in the fall, we can't be blinded by the light at the end of the tunnel.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India's surge is a reminder that the virus is learning and adapting to us faster than we are learning.The risk of the Pandemic is increasing as it is more severe than ever.If we get our response right, we can save more than a million lives in the next year.Although Israel, the UK, and the US will enter a new reality with the virus largely tamed by vaccines, global vaccination lags badly.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most countries don't have enough vaccine, and low-income countries don't have enough vaccine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus is gathering strength and speed.If we are to win the war against Covid, global cooperation is essential.It takes weeks to months to roll out vaccines and get them into enough people's arms to make a difference.It takes several more weeks before protection kicks in.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's needs cannot be met by our vaccine infrastructure.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if there were enough vaccines, they wouldn't stop the spread of the virus.It is possible for countries with excess supply to make a difference.There will be enough vaccines in 2021, but companies missed their 2020 production projections, and overall production is still only a quarter of projected need.Potential need for booster doses, production delays, and Variants which could overwhelm some vaccines are all real risks.We can't bet on vaccine and production being stable.The vaccines that are proven to be effective need to be scaled up as quickly as possible.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm worried that we're now at the most dangerous phase of the Pandemic.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covid is becoming deadlier and more transmissible, the virus is circulating at higher levels in more places, and after more than a year of having our lives disrupted there's increasing human fatigue.The number of deaths will go up in 2021.Pandemics aren't natural disasters.We have shown that we can control Covid.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put on a mask.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay away to avoid superspreading.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continue essential services.Health care workers and older people should bevaccinated.We need a focused, well-managed, accountable approach for each of these six.We need to do better protecting health care workers.It will save lives from Covid and other diseases when care is disrupted.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;Fauci and Gupta discuss the year of the coronaviruses&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Dr. Anthony Fauci, a scientist, doctor and public servant who, at this point, practically needs no introduction, will be at or near the top of the list for many.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long-time director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and currently the chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden, Fauci was a lead member of the last administration\'s White House Coronaviruses Task Force.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had to walk a fine line between what former President Trump said and what Science said.Fauci was a steady, calming voice for many who looked to him for guidance during an unprecedented, confusing and often-chaotic time.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asymptomatic spread!There is a lack of PPE.Not enough tests!Surges!Hospitals are overflowing!The death toll was over 500,000.He wasvilified for favoring public health measures meant to keep Americans healthy.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don\'t shy away from that because I think I could have a positive impact.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I think to myself, if I were in your shoes, I might just throw my hands up and walk away.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you feel that way?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fauci: No, I don\'t, because I like to think of it as when you\'re taking care of a patient and they\'re really, really sick.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don\'t walk away from them because of that.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You try to comfort them, save them and make them better.It\'s almost like I\'m walking away from my patient, which is the country.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don\'t want to do that.Gupta thinks that the idea that the patient can be an embodiment of the country is true.You\'ve talked about how things have changed with the Biden administration.We hear more from you.What is it like behind the scenes?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it\'s inconvenient, so be it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s going to rule on evidence and data.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He made it very clear in general, and he specifically told me that, and it gets translated right down the line.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You feel like you\'re part of a team that\'s pulling together, all on the foundation of \'Let\'s get it right\' and \'Let\'s do it based on data.\' If we fall below 10,000 cases per day, that would be an indication to you that we are heading into containment mode.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How important is it to inject certainty into these discussions if you keep the same metaphor?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That\'s a great question, Fauci.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You get a credibility issue if you give an impression that you\'re certain, but it doesn\'t happen.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People want to know something.I think things are getting to the point where we can start approaching normal.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For sure, it\'s not 60,000 new cases a day.Is it more than 10,000?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe.I think so.I don\'t know for certain until we\'re there.It\'s understandable that people want a number.I would like to know when you think we can start approaching normality.I told you that I didn\'t have a clue.I don\'t know.You won\'t get me and say, "Aha!"You gave me a wrong number.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe you\'re going to write a book yourself.Is there a specific thing that you would like to include in your legacy when it comes to Covid-19, something that you would want to make sure was included in these books?Fauci: Yes.I do it every single day.I don\'t mean to be melodramatic about it, but I\'m a physician and a scientist and when I entered into the arena of global health, the country became my patient.I want to be remembered for taking good care of my patient.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don\'t think we\'ll become standoffish, but I do think that people are going to be thinking about public health more when there is an outbreak of flu.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We learned that the public health measure we instituted to keep out Covid-19 wiped out the flu in Australia.We\'ve had less flu this year than we have in the past.The other thing I think is going to be different is that people are going to realize that flying to Paris to give a 35-minute lecture is not a good idea.I think you\'re going to see a lot more people not going out of their way, but communicating in a way that you and I can understand.Is money more important than anything else going forward to try and make us pandemic-proof, so to speak?Fauci: It is money, but it is also a realization of what can happen now.We\'ve been talking about this for a long time.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;"It's not the end of the show, it's the beginning of a new chapter"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"We felt it was time after almost 300 episodes.Thanks in no small part to the vaccines available to us, the course of the Pandemic in the United States has been experiencing a slow but noticeable shift, and we want to create stories that mirror this change for our audience.We decided to start the next chapter after turning the page on the old one.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People wanted to know how bad it is.How bad is it going to get?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation was not at all clear, even for someone who had the privilege of interviewing some of the brightest minds working on the cutting edge of coronaviruses science, medicine, research.Jeff Zucker, President of CNN Worldwide, would like to start doing a daily show on Coronaviruses next week.I was scared to take it on because the weeks leading up to that email had been the busiest of my life, and having gone through surgical residency, that's saying something!I had been covering the global health crisis for 19 hours a day, but I didn't know how I could fit it in.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of 14 months, we had millions of people subscribe to the show, and thousands of questions come in via voice message.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite things to do is listen to the audience through these messages.It felt like we built a strong community of people who supported each other along the way.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was reminded that we are all in this together.If it worked out so well, why are we changing the show now?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are fortunate that we have turned a corner in the Pandemic here in the United States.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than half of Americans over the age of 18 are at least partially vaccined.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We expect to hear soon that 12 to 15-year-olds can get their shots as well.A trial investigator is immunizing children as young as 5 years old as part of a trial.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the country were my patient, I would call it an occupational hazard because it was developing the first worrisome symptoms.In mid-November, I called what was unfolding here a humanitarian disaster, as bad as any I had seen in my 20 years of reporting.The patient is not out of the woods yet, and I will always be honest about the state of the country.There are around 54,000 new cases and 670 deaths a day, and cases are going up in six states.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do we get around?Our population is not healthy.High rates of obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes are the risk factors that made us individually more vulnerable to getting severely sick with Covid-19 as the pandemic took hold.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to learn how to live optimal lives so that we can be more resilient against future health crises.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new series will explore the surprising science behind health, happiness and fulfillment.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'll talk to medical experts, friends, my wife, and even some of you to share the best ways we can rebuild with intention in the coming months and maximize our minds and bodies to really thrive.I want to assure you that I won't stop covering this epidemic, if you sign up here.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will leave a mark on us for the rest of our lives, so it will continue to be a part of the new episodes.Maybe some good can come out of this, even though there was nothing good about it.We may never be able to return to a pre-2020 world, but it's time to start moving forward and unleashing our potential.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;There have been reports of breakthrough infections with coronaviruses&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"Two reports of so-called coronaviruses breakthrough infections suggest that the vaccines still offer strong protection against severe disease even in the face of variations.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The co-author of the study said the two cases weren't cause for alarm.There were at- home cases of Covid-19.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the number of fully-vaccinated people increases in the U.S., so, too, will reports of breakthrough infections rise.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday that it had received reports of around 5,800 breakthrough infections out of 77 million fully-vaccinated people.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDC officials are gathering more data about breakthrough cases to determine if there are any patterns.There are questions about whether certain variants are more likely to play a role in breakthrough cases.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They did not include all the mutations to match the previously identified variant.Experts cautioned that it's too early to draw conclusions about which variant is most likely to lead to breakthrough infections, because the report only detailed two cases.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is thought to help the virus evade the body's immune response.There were 22 breakthrough infections across 78 Chicago-area nursing homes, which fully vaccined nearly 15,000 residents and staff members from December through March.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report said that in two-thirds of the breakthrough cases, the infections were not life threatening.The second report focused on a Covid-19 outbreak at a nursing home in Kentucky in March.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 26 residents and 20 staff members who tested positive.The results of the study show that those who werevaccinated were 87 percent less likely to develop symptoms than those who were unvaccinated.One of the patients in the New England Journal of Medicine report, a healthy 51-year-old woman, tested positive for Covid-19 on March 10.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second patient, a 65-year-old woman with no risk factors for severe Covid-19, tested positive 36 days after her second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.Two weeks after her unvaccinated partner was diagnosed with Covid-19, she got sick.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As in the first case, her symptoms went away after a few days, so it would be wise to get tested for Covid-19 if you do get sick."&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;Latino actors debunk Covid-19 vaccine myths&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"The brother of the chief medical officer of a hospital in New York City contracted the virus while on the front line of the fight against the Pandemic.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Del Toro was told by his brother that one of the reasons for low vaccination rates in Latino communities was lack of information and outreach.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the nation preparing to meet President Joe Biden's goal of administering 200 million shots, the Puerto Rican actor decided to partner with the actor to create a bilingual campaign to combat vaccine misinformation.The video campaign features the chief medical officer at the Wyckoff Heights Medical Center as he answers questions from his brother and sister to clarify some of the most common myths about Covid-19 vaccines.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost two-thirds of this group are white, 12 percent are Hispanic, 9 percent are black, and 6 percent are Asian.The loss of young Latino lives, particularly those in their 30s and 40s, led to a reduction in overall Latino population according to the CDC.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The videos will be distributed with the help of the Momento Latino advocacy group.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don't want to tell people what to do.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want to let people make their own decisions and bring out the information about the vaccines."&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;200 million Covid vaccinations will be promised by Biden in 100 daysThe numbers say this&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;If the country keeps up with its current pace of vaccinations that goal will be achieved, according to an NBC News analysis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention figures.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden had increased his goal to 150 million shots in arms in his first 100 days in office.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the article was published, Biden changed his goal from 150 million to 100 million.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the days and weeks before entering office, he said his goal was 100 million vaccinations.While Biden\'s chief of staff had called the 100 million goal "ambitious," the vaccination rate necessary to reach the mark is not much higher than what the rate was Jan. The total vaccinations given are what is being counted.Full vaccinations include the first and second shots, which are counted as one.Biden mentioned shots in arms in his statements about the goal.NBC News is publishing a vaccine guide.&lt;p&gt;

0,2,&lt;p&gt;Stress and fatigue are shown in a survey by the Ohio Regulator&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;According to a report released by Ohio\'s pharmacy regulators Tuesday, half of the nation\'s pharmacists don\'t have enough time to complete their job safely.NBC News reported in March that understaffed pharmacists at chain drug stores say they are reaching a breaking point, based on increasing complaints from them.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to the survey results, the Ohio Board of Pharmacy voted unanimously Tuesday to create a committee to make recommendations on addressing issues raised by the survey.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Board looks forward to working with stakeholders on its newly formed Pharmacist Workload Advisory Committee to discuss this important issue and develop recommendations to promote safer working conditions for pharmacists and pharmacy staff.Most of the pharmacists in those work environments said they didn\'t feel they had enough staffing for patient safety and that they felt pressured to meet metrics that could interfere with patient care.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked for additional comments at the end of the survey, multiple pharmacists noted that shift lengths were a major stressor.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One wrote, "12 hour shifts are brutal."It\'s too long for a single pharmacist to work.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked to comment on the survey results, the National Association of Chain Drug Stores referred to the statement it provided."Patient safety is a pharmacy\'s top priority, and extensive care is taken to foster it," the organization said, and it is advocating for state-level policies essential for furtherOptimizing care."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Errors in the pharmacy can be small, like miscounting the number of pills in a bottle, to potentially deadly, like missing a dangerous drug interaction.Those that make it to regulators are taken seriously and, in some cases, can cost a pharmacist their license.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are cutting hours and expecting us to do more with less.I feel like there are a lot of errors in my pharmacy.If we were allowed to work at a safe pace, this would be completely preventable.The concerns of Ohio\'s survey respondents match those expressed by 31 retail pharmacists and pharmacy technicians in 15 states who spoke to NBC News in 2020.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;Wealthy Latin Americans travel to the US to get Covid vaccines&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"They travel thousands of miles by plane from Latin America to the U.S. in some places taking a shuttle directly from the airport to the vaccine sites.Their ranks include politicians, TV personalities, business executives and a soccer team.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People of means from Latin America are chartering planes, booking commercial flights, buying bus tickets and renting cars to get the vaccine in the United States due to lack of supply at home.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They traveled for a second time.The doctor who was treating the husband for cancer told the couple to act.They traveled 1,400 miles to get a Covid-19 vaccine in the United States.In Mexico, officials did not buy enough vaccines.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who make the trip must obtain a tourist visa and have enough money to pay for required coronaviruses tests, plane tickets, hotel rooms, rental cars and other expenses.With land entry points closed to non essential travel, the couple decided to take a commercial flight to Houston and then travel by bus.In Peru, an economist running for president faced a backlash after he admitted he traveled to the U.S. to get a vaccine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Latorre traveled to Miami to have her elderly mother receive a vaccine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly half of the US, including Texas, Arizona, and California, do not require proof of residency to get a vaccine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people have second homes in the U.S. and others have a U.S. address. ejandra, a dentist who lives in Monterrey, said she decided to seek a vaccine in the U.S. after losing her mother to Covid-19.She registered online at a pharmacy in Texas and flew to Houston to get her second Moderna shot.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She asked that her full name not be published because she is afraid of retribution after seeing reports that those who traveled to get vaccines in the U.S. could lose their visas.Only 2% of the country's 32 million people have received a dose.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He plans to travel to other states if he can't get inoculated in Texas.He said that he would like to get the vaccine in the US because he works with people."&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;"Concerns over first shot's protection prompted the shift of Covid vaccine drive to second doses"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Due to concerns over supply shortages and data showing scant protection from one dose of the Sinovac Biotech(SVA.O)vaccine that formed the backbone of its campaign,Chile is shifting its Covid-19 vaccination strategy toward issuing second doses, while slowing administration of new shots.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government said the bulk would be delivered before the end of September, but could not give a delivery date.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have agreements with many different companies and the vaccines will keep coming."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country plans to give 760,000 second shots this week because of data showing a single dose of the Sinovac shot provides little protection.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we don\'t give the second dose, the situation could be much worse.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he was confident he could keep the supply taps open.Yanez said his team was pushing Sinovac to deliver another 4 million doses, and that the first of 4 million doses purchased directly from AstraZeneca should begin arriving in May.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can reach herd immunity by the middle of the year.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;A state of emergency is being eyed for Tokyo and Osaka&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"NHK reported on Wednesday that Japan's government is considering a state of emergency for Tokyo and Osaka as new Covid-19 case numbers surge.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just three months before the planned start of the Tokyo Olympics and amid a sluggish vaccine roll-out, Tokyo reported the most infections since January.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Case numbers in Osaka have exceeded those in Tokyo in recent days, reaching a record 1,351 on April 13.Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike is preparing to request an emergency period be declared from April 29 to May 9.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government of Kyoto prefecture in western Japan is preparing to request an emergency declaration.The total economic loss from a renewed emergency in the three regions would be over $10 billion, according to a report.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his visit to the United States, the Prime Minister was in talks with the CEO of Pfizer to get more vaccine doses.The company did not reply immediately."&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;The states are rolling back Covid restrictions&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;In the first week of March, governors in Mississippi, Texas, Alabama, Arizona, West Virginia and Connecticut loosened statewide restrictions on coronaviruses.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September of last year, Florida became one of the largest states to roll back Covid capacity restrictions.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 546,000 people have died in the United States.On March 4, Gov. Kay Ivey extended Alabama\'s statewide mask mandate for another year, until April 9, 2021.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alabama would not follow other states and immediately end restrictions without allowing more time for more Alabamians to get their first shot, according to the governor.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is not Texas, this is not Mississippi, this is Connecticut," he said.Many restaurants will not be able to seat the same number of guests because of social distancing and cleaning protocols still in effect.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holcomb announced on March 23 that the state\'s mask mandate would be relaxed to a mask advisory on April 6, and that most decisions about coronaviruses health restrictions would be left up to local officials.It is the right thing to do.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state\'s mask mandate was ended in February by Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds.The vaccine is being quickly distributed, and hospitalizations and case numbers have plummeted.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our hospitalizations and case numbers have plummeted, and the vaccine is being rapidly distributed.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several local governments have kept the statewide mask mandate in place, despite Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte announcing the end of it on February 12.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve Sisolak, a Democrat, said on April 13 that his goal was for Nevada businesses to reopen to full capacity by June 1, and that he would turn over statewide rulemaking on social distancing and other Covid mitigation efforts to local authorities on May 1.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Oklahoma, the standard for normal is freedom.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 5, the governor of South Carolina ended the requirement that face coverings be worn in state government buildings and restaurants.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is getting better every day, hospitalization and death numbers have improved, and anyone 55 or older will be eligible for the vaccine Monday," McMaster said at the vaccine event.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The South Carolina Senate Democratic Caucus called it reckless as the virus continues to sicken and kill, and said it was done to score political points.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice said, "I can\'t stand these masks myself, I get that and everything, none of us can."Justice warned not to get too anxious to lift everything away and then get some level of whiplash that really hurts us.&lt;p&gt;

0,2,&lt;p&gt;Experts say clear treatment guidance is the key to bringing back Johnson & Johnson Covid vaccines&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;It will require clear guidelines for the medical community on how to best treat patients that develop a rare type of blood clot, as well as alerting vaccine recipients to be aware of the telltale symptoms.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A panel of experts will meet later this week to decide if the pause should continue.Anthony Fauci, chief medical advisor to President Joe Biden, said on NBC\'s "Meet the Press" that they will continue to use it.There will likely be some sort of warning or restriction or risk assessment.Scientists have yet to establish a direct link between the J&J vaccine and the blood clot, which have also been identified among a tiny fraction of people who received the Covid-19.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association said on Friday that headaches, abdominal pain, and confusion could occur up to two weeks after vaccination.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most strokes occur in the arteries, rather than in the brain\'s veins, and the FDA has said that patients who exhibit clot-related symptoms after receiving treatment.The rare combination of clotting and low platelets signals a condition called heparin-associated thrombocytopenia, which can cause harm, and the FDA warned healthcare providers that use of heparin in these cases could even be fatal. The patient remained critically ill at the time of the report, so that\'s a good reason to call the attention to this.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials at J&J and AstraZeneca did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;Some states are allowing people from out of state to get vaccinations&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;In addition to making every adult eligible for the shots Monday, several states lifted their residency requirements, meaning that providers will vaccine even non-residents.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can check the map to see if your state is on it.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;Half of US adults have received at least one vaccine shot&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Half of all adults in the U.S. have received at least one Covid-19 shot, the government announced Sunday, marking another milestone in the nation\'s largest-ever vaccine campaign but leaving more work to do to convince skeptical Americans to roll up their sleeves.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A day after the global death toll from the coronaviruses topped 3 million, the U.S. cleared the 50 percent mark.The vaccine campaign offered hope in places like Nashville, Tennessee, where the Music City is located.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High demand for appointment-only shots at the convention center has leveled off enough that walk-ins will be welcome starting this week.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grimsley said that he hasn\'t been able to see his grandmother in a year and a half.My entire family has never gone without seeing her.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The states with the highest vaccination rates have a history of voting Democratic and supporting President Joe Biden in the 2020 election.Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi voted for Donald Trump last fall.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a poll conducted in March, 36 percent of Republicans said they will probably or definitely not get vaccine, compared with 12 percent of Democrats.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third of rural Americans said they were leaning against getting shots, while fewer than a fourth of people living in cities and suburbs said the same.The figure has climbed to 75 percent, according to the latest AP-NORC poll.26% of white Americans say they won\'t get vaccine.That number was 31 percent in January.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no sign of clot problems with the most widely used Covid-19 vaccines.&lt;p&gt;

0,2,&lt;p&gt;The death toll from Covid-19 has topped 3 million&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"The global death toll from the coronaviruses topped 3 million on Saturday, despite repeated setbacks in the worldwide vaccine campaign and a crisis in places such as Brazil, India and France.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The true number is believed to be significantly higher because of possible government concealment and the many cases overlooked in the early stages of the outbreak.Today, they are underway in more than 190 countries, though progress in bringing the virus under control varies widely.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hospitals are running out of critical sedatives as a more contagious variant of the virus has been rampaging across the country.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, there have been reports of some doctors changing what supplies remain and even tying patients to their beds while breathing tubes are pushed down their throats.It was too late to get large quantities in time in India, where cases spiked in February after weeks of steady decline.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India saw over 180,000 new infections in a single day, bringing the total number of cases to over 13 million.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 87 percent of the 700 million doses of vaccine have been given out in rich countries.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. and some European countries put the use of Johnson & Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine on hold while authorities investigate extremely rare but, while 1 in 4 people in wealthy nations have received a vaccine, in poor countries the figure is 1 in more than 500.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., where over 560,000 lives have been lost, accounting for more than 1 in 6 of the world's Covid-19 deaths, hospitalizations and deaths have dropped.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of deaths in the US has fallen from a high of 3,400 in January to 700 per day now."&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;FedEx killings mark return of mass workplace shootings&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"The mass shooting at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis was the deadliest workplace shooting in over a year, and experts warned Friday that such incidents could increase as more people return to work.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some who felt slighted by supervisors while working from home will be face to face with their bosses for the first time in months.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Christopher Herrmann, an assistant professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, workplace shootings are going to go up because people think other people are getting the promotions.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kids are back in school and that will cause school shootings to go up.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Same as work situations.While investigators have identified the Indiana shooter, they have not yet determined a motive.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delivery workers, especially those who risked their lives to earn a living, may have built-up resentments against their employers as they were under increased stress at the peak of the Pandemic.You can't kill the company.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Indiana shooting occurred about a week after police said a Texas man opened fire at a cabinet manufacturing plant in the small city of Bryan, killing one co-worker and wounding five others.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The director of the Buehler said that the sudden resurgence of mass workplace shootings is not simply the result of more people returning to work.Mass shooters want to kill as many people as possible and get as much attention as possible.There is more room in the media for something else now that Covid is starting to decline and we have a president who is not involved in scandal after scandal.The United States averaged one mass shooting a week in 2019.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could be a build up of frustration by some people."&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;If you can find a vehicle, car rental costs are going to go down&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"Heading to Maui for a delayed vacation?Travelers arriving at Hawaii's Kahului Airport without a reservation for an April weekend will find major car rental companies completely sold out.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a vehicle is available with local competitors, it could run several times more than normal, with some tourists reporting car rental prices of more than $700 a day, or $1,000 for a convertible.Even in less glamorous destinations, like Detroit, it can be difficult to find the normal choice of vehicles.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Detroit Metropolitan Airport, the current weekend rate for a Chevrolet Spark microcar is $104.30 a day, almost three times the pre-pandemic price.Because of the spike in demand in some cities and regions and tighter fleets across the car rental industry, availability may be more limited.While travel has been on the rise, that's not the only reason why there's a sudden shortage of rental cars.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the final quarter of 2020, the company reported having around 300,000 vehicles in its fleet, 42 percent lower than a year earlier.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avis was able to dispose of 250,000 of its own vehicles in 2020.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With demand still low, rental firms slashed orders for replacement vehicles.Rental companies and fleets accounted for most of the decline in new vehicle sales during the third quarter.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They aren't in a rush to shift back.Travelers are advised to schedule rental cars as far in advance as possible because manufacturers are not going to send vehicles to the rental side when they can make more money through their retail channels."&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;Doctors are on alert for blood clot linked to J&J vaccine&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Doctors across the country are on high alert for rare blood clot linked to the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine since the shot was put on pause Tuesday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC has reached out to over 10,000 providers to make sure they know what kind of cases to look for.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One has been released from the hospital.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the cases were in white women.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said every provider in her network has received guidance on the issue.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a patient has a blood clot, doctors are told to ask if they\'ve received a Covid-19 vaccine, and if so, which one.The vaccine has not been authorized for use in the U.S., but is used in other countries.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six patients who received the Johnson & Johnson shot became ill six to 13 days after they got the vaccine, and doctors said it was important to have the vaccine timed.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A low level of platelets is an important clue which can be measured with a blood test, as the clot specific to the six patients linked to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine were found in combination with a low level of platelets.As many as 900,000 people a year are affected by a deep vein thrombosis.It\'s essential to have the skills to recognize the condition, particularly for appropriate treatment, as experts say that just because a person has received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and subsequently developed a blood clot does not prove the two are related.Similar to what has been seen in the Johnson & Johnson cases, the medication does the opposite in rare cases.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;Brazil needs sedatives for critically ill patients&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;An emergency shipment of sedatives needed to intubate severely ill COVID-19 patients arrived in Brazil late on Thursday from China, as the South American country scrambles for supplies due to severe shortages of the vital drugs.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has only recently embraced vaccines as a possible solution.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cargo of 2.3 million drugs, donated by major Brazilian companies including miner Vale and oil producer Petrobras, touched down in Sao Paulo just after 10 p.m. local time.&lt;p&gt;

0,2,&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer's CEO says the Covid-19 booster shot probably needs to be shot within a year"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said Thursday that people are likely to need a third dose of the vaccine within a year if they want to protect against the coronaviruses.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's likely that a booster will be needed within 12 months of the initial two-shot regimen, according to Boulla.Bourla told CNBC on Thursday that it is important to suppress the pool of people that can be susceptible to the virus.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine was found to be effective against several known coronaviruses, including one that was first reported in the U.K. and another that was thought to have emerged in South Africa.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that it will be important over the next year as new coronaviruses emerge and circulate around the world."&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;About 5,800 infections have been reported in fully vaccineed people&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The CDC is keeping a close eye on Covid-19 cases in fully vaccineed people, the agency\'s director said on Thursday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tara Smith, a professor of epidemiology at the Kent State University College of Public Health in Ohio, told NBC News that the data is reassuring.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of them have been normal.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That\'s what we were hoping for, and the majority of people with breakthrough infections were not hospitalized.The data is not publicly available yet, but the CDC expects to start publishing information on breakthrough infections on its website starting Monday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency also plans to collect additional data on the cases, including demographic, vaccine type, variant type, location and the amount of time since the individuals had completed their vaccinations."We are reaching out to all of our state health officials, as well as to our hospitals," Walensky said.I would like to know if the patients had other risk factors, such as compromised immune systems, or if they continued to wear masks after the vaccine.It\'s possible that health care systems require regular testing.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They don\'t have much in the way of symptoms, and are hospitalized for other reasons," said Bill Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology.It is thought that the number of breakthrough infections reported to the CDC is probably an underestimate.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As federal health officials investigate cases of rare blood clot linked to the shots, use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is currently paused in the U.S. A CDC study published in March found that the Pfizer and the Moderna vaccines were about 90 percent effective against infections.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;A high number of babies and children are dying in Brazil&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"According to the Health Ministry, over 800 children under the age of 9 have died of Covid-19, even though there's overwhelming evidence that it rarely kills young children.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Fatima Marinho, a senior adviser to the international non-governmental organization Vital Strategies, the virus has killed 2,060 children under the age of 9.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been 10 times more deaths from an unexplained respiratory syndrome over the past than there are for Covid-19.The rare syndrome is a serious health condition associated with the Covid-19 infections.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It tends to affect children up to six weeks after they are exposed to the coronaviruses.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each week there is a grim new record of deaths and infections, and yet there is still no coordinated centralized response.Last week, more than a quarter of the world's coronaviruses deaths were in Brazil.If nothing changes, Christou expects the situation to get worse in the coming weeks.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts in Brazil say low coronaviruses testing rates, lack of contact tracing efforts and a shortage of vaccines have contributed to rises in cases and deaths.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Failure to adapt evidence-based public health measures has sent far too many to an early grave.Christou called for an urgent, science-based and well-coordinated reset to prevent further avoidable deaths and the destruction of the Brazilian health system."&lt;p&gt;

0,2,&lt;p&gt;I took a selfies after getting the Johnson & Johnson vaccineThings got weird after that&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;I got a vaccine in Washington state on Monday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best vaccine to get is the first one you can get, so I was pleasantly surprised when the medical professional administering the shot told me, as though it were a restaurant.Is it possible to schedule one less appointment?The sun was shining when I arrived back home that afternoon, and I snapped a selfies under the tree in my backyard to post on social media.My social media timelines were full of real-life friends mugging beneath their masks and flashing their vaccine cards for weeks.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I thought was a vaccine selfies was actually being retweeted with comments from strangers like, "One and done all right," and "Oh honey, I\'ve got bad news."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after the news came out, people were still searching for the phrase "Johnson & Johnson" to celebrate.It\'s a powerful reminder that there are people searching for the phrase "Johnson & Johnson" to gloat about the fact that I wrote about getting a vaccine to prevent severe illness and hospitalization from a Covid-19 infection.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a casual moralizing about the victim when something horrible happens to someone, where they invoke "rationality" to assert that there is something they would have had.The climate means that, if I do happen to be, I will use victim blaming to distract my own feelings of vulnerability as a result of cognitive bias and the brain\'s need to maintain a belief in a just world.The goal posts were moved when necessary because of the president\'s lead in downplaying the danger.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence that Black and brown people were disproportionately likely to contract, be hospitalized for and die from Covid-19 or that obesity, diabetes and lung disease are co-morbidities led to the emergence of this strain of thought.And me.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This climate means that if I happen to be the next woman to die from an adverse reaction to Johnson & Johnson\'s vaccine, it will be because of the 6.8 million people who received the shot.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I probably can\'t protest that I\'m not a sheep, that\'s probably just what a sheep would do, so instead I\'ll Gen Xers came of age in the 1980s consuming vast quantities of mass media, and we gradually deduced from its messages that we were unlikely to live past our 20s.It was only one month out of the year when Halloween candy was spiked with poison, but it was still a risk.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ronald Reagan was blithely ignoring the AIDS crisis because his friends in the Christian fundamentalist movement assured him it was God\'s punishment for homosexuality and nothing for good Americans to fear.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And me.The media and political forces have decided that anything done in the service of public health is aninfringement on their individual rights, even by pointing out that not being forcibly exposed is.We can help make sure that public health experts can do their work, which includes changing their plans in response to new information and keeping the vaccines\' costs and benefits in perspective.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don\'t use know-nothing as a know-it-all.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are too many people on the social networking site.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;The CDC panel is requesting more information about the Johnson & Johnson vaccine&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;An advisory panel to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declined to make any new recommendations on the use of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine, which will remain paused as the investigation into rare reports of severe blood clot continues.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The committee is an independent panel of health experts, outside of the CDC.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some ACIP members expressed concern over a continued pause, particularly as the number of new cases reported each day continues to hold steady at more than 60,000 per day.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the wide availability of other Covid-19 vaccines at this time and the severity of the risk, the committee is in a little bit of a different position.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said they don\'t have enough data.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration is paying close attention to the committee\'s analysis.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there are new findings in the investigation, the FDA could change Johnson & Johnson\'s emergency use authorization.The CDC, along with the FDA, first recommended the pause Tuesday after six people developed rare but serious blood clot after getting the Johnson & Johnson vaccine shots.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shots were stopped in all 50 states because of six cases of blood clot in vessels leading out of the brain.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the cases were in white women between the ages of 18 and 48 and occurred six to 13 days after they received the shot.No one had recently given birth.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three of them were obese.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were no other pre-existing conditions linked to the cases.Four patients are still not recovered.The sixth patient was released from the hospital.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A member of the CDC\'s Covid-19 Vaccine Task Force said he believed the clotting events to be at least three.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The formation of those clot seems to mirror what\'s happening in these rare cases after administration of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want people who have received a vaccine, and their health care providers, to be aware of these events, and report them to the CDC and FDA."The Johnson & Johnson vaccine has been given to 7.4 million people so far.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Half of those were given within the past two weeks.There have been no reports of similar blood clot with low platelets associated with those vaccines, which use a different type of technology.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;ProfessorSnape went viral for the Covid-19 vaccine study&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;A recent study of coronaviruses vaccines led by Dr. Matthew Snape, a professor at the University of Oxford in the U.K., sent Twitter users and "Harry Potter" fans into a frenzy this week.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matthew is an associate professor at the University of Oxford.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wants to use new vaccine technology to boost protections against Covid-19.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the trial is to see if mixing Covid-19 vaccines with different formulas for the first and second doses will increase efficacy.We want to make sure that our Snape is not a \'Dark Arts\' professor.He works on the #OxfordVaccine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study only tested mice, so taking the next step to involve human data could bring more answers.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;Some states on the US electoral map are lagging on vaccinations&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The parts of the U.S. that are doing well and those that are struggling with vaccinations are starting to look like the nation\'s political map.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Mexico, Connecticut, Maine and Massachusetts are close behind.All have a history of voting Democratic and supporting President Joe Biden in the 2020 election.Four of them, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana and Tennessee, lean Republican and voted for Donald Trump.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than a third of rural Americans said they were leaning against getting a vaccine, and less than a fourth of people living in cities and suburbs said the same.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to know how many people are resisting because everyone wants the shots.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said consequences could be serious if states see a lot of unfilled appointments with people still unvaccinated.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will determine if we go back to normal in some cases.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to AP-NORC polls, more Republicans than Democrats say the government exaggerated the threat posed by the virus.Almost 50 percent of the US adult population have received at least one coronaviruses shot, and Republicans have been more opposed to restrictions and mask-wearing.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California is slightly ahead of that pace, at 50 percent.Texas is the biggest red state and lags at less than 44 percent.As a whole, blue states Oregon and Michigan are at 45 percent each.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Republican Gov. Jim Justice has remained a vaccine cheerleader, West Virginia now lags the U.S. overall with less than 42% of its population having received at least one dose.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sitting outside her apartment complex in Charleston, West Virginia, Brown said she\'s afraid of having a bad reaction after a flu shot last year left her with cold symptoms.It\'s too soon to tell if pausing shots of the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine will increase reluctance to get vaccine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government scientists are investigating reports of blood clot in six women who received the vaccine.If the issue gets resolved quickly and it\'s deemed safe to resume Johnson & Johnson shots, there should be little impact on public confidence.She hopes the response assures people that the system is working.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a suburb outside Chicago, Jennifer Rockwood was getting ready to drive an hour to get her Johnson & Johnson shot Tuesday morning when she heard about the recommended pause.She had to cancel her appointment because she hadn\'t gotten the vaccine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rockwood said yes it did.She booked an appointment to get the Pfizer vaccine Wednesday, after flipping the laptop open again and seeing what she could do to schedule another one.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though he was hospitalized with Covid-19, the president spent a lot of his time minimizing the dangers of the disease.Many other U.S. governors have gotten their shots on camera or held news conferences around them in an effort to assure people the vaccines are safe.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Kentucky, 1.6 million people have gotten at least one dose.Andy Beshear said Monday he\'ll lift capacity restrictions on restaurants, retail stores, concert halls and other businesses once Kentucky reaches 2.5 million people who have had shots.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;The Johnson & Johnson Covid vaccine pause is rough on public trust&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the percentage of Americans who planned to wait to get a Covid-19 vaccine had dropped.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news on Tuesday that the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were recommending a several has not changed the fact that those who say they won't ever get it has remained fairly constant at 20 percent or just over.Even as we clapped for doctors and called nurses and other front-line health care workers heroes, our trust in public health has dropped from what was already low levels compared to other countries.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More deserved coverage of health inequalities and systemic injustice in the health care system is likely to contribute to the lack of trust.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anti-vax movement has made it difficult for people to dispassionately assess the risks and benefits of vaccines.The American people have unprecedented access to a free preventive intervention that is highly effective at preventing severe disease and death from a highly infectious disease.We need better communication on risk assessment, but we also need to understand that nuance is important in these conversations.In the U.S., there are currently six cases identified, one of which was fatal, out of 6.8 million people who received the shot before.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people don't know their susceptibility to blood clot, and there are several genetic conditions that make one prone to it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How these and other behavioral risk factors might interact together in relation to blood clot is already a difficult question to answer, before one even begins to take into account the Co Adverse events can happen after taking medication or getting a vaccine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More rare adverse events start to show up when any medical intervention is introduced to a larger population.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important to compare the rates of these events between those who have been vaccine-free and the general population.It is difficult to study very rare events because they are hard to find large numbers of people who have them.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strength of association, timing, a dose-response relationship, biological plausibility and others are some of the criteria used to establish causality.There was confusion about whether pregnant and breastfeeding people should get the Covid-19 vaccine because they were excluded from the trials.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the European Union and the United Kingdom, regulators have decided that the risk of blood clot is very small and that healthy people under 30 who are not at risk for severe Covid-19 should be offered a different type of vaccine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine hesitancy that we saw in Europe was due to the fact that the risk of blood clot was very low and the vaccine was safe.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Poland, where it is almost the only option, a recent poll shows that more than 95 percent of people would choose any other vaccine.Blood clot can be caused by genetic and behavioral factors.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that Covid-19 is known to cause blood clot is lost in the vaccine controversy.The risk of the disease, at this point, outweighs the risk of the vaccine.When my work colleagues called to see why I wasn't at work, I had lost consciousness and thrown up from the pain.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors eventually determined that mine was the result of a combination of three risk factors: my genes, my hormones, and my smoking.We will understand more about the relationship between these risk factors in the coming months and years.What is your chance of getting Covid-19?Do you have a risk for severe disease?What is the normal risk for blood clot?If you were going to get a vaccine before this news, go ahead and get it.&lt;p&gt;

0,2,&lt;p&gt;The study found that global suicide rates did not increase at the beginning of the epidemic&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Despite evidence that depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts were all heightened, there was no increase in suicide rates during the first few months of the coronaviruses.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most places, including many areas of the U.S., suicide rates were flat or even declined, according to a study by the Centre for Mental Health at the University of Melbourne, Australia.They cautioned that they do not necessarily reflect mental health and how the Pandemic has affected it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The numbers should not be used to say that fewer people killed themselves in the early part of the Pandemic.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Singer is an associate professor of social work at Loyola University Chicago and president of the American Association of Suicidology.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depressive symptoms, eating disorders, all those things have gone up.The numbers do not show how certain groups of people fare.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Singer, who was not involved in the study, said that the number of suicides was largely unchanged or down.It also excluded low-income and lower-middle-income countries.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many countries implemented financial safety nets, such as eviction moratoriums, that may have helped, as the authors pointed out.In 12 countries or areas, including California, parts of Texas and in Cook County, Illinois, there was a decrease in suicide rates compared to previous years.The data was only for the first few months of the epidemic, so it does not offer a full trajectory of suicide rates.She hopes that we keep paying attention to mental health and other factors that contribute to suicide.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;Black maternal health is more important than ever&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Maternal health advocates are focusing their attention on the particular crisis of care for pregnant Black women during the Pandemic because of the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on Black communities.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of the health crisis, pregnant Black women in particular are reportedly enduring limited in-person prenatal care, limited support during labor, social isolation and increased economic anxiety.There is no concrete data yet available to determine the toll of the pandemic on them, but advocates like Dana Sherrod, birth equity and racial justice manager with the Cherished Futures for Black Moms and Babies, Public Health Alliance, are already expecting bleak outcomes.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know that high stress pregnant contributes to some of the inequalities we see," she said.Black women have unique experiences and Covid is adding to their stress.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 11 through April 17 is Black Maternal Health Week, which aims to shed light on Black women\'s maternal and reproductive care.Three years ago, the Black Mamas Matter Alliance launched, and the cause has gained attention due to the disparity in Black maternal care.Many public health professionals, reproductive justice advocates, doulas, and more across the country participate in the weeklong event with everything from webinars and training to mutual aid.Many of this year\'s events are virtual, which only underscores the multitude ways Covid-19 is affecting not only Black maternal health, but also the communal nature that has come to define Black Maternal Health Week.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had food drives.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of our virtual events were beefed up and we shared more resources with our community.The impact of discharge, going home and not having the usual village to support us is definitely a challenge.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones said that the Action Team connected families with organizations that met their needs.She said that collaboration was crucial throughout 2020.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A September 2020 study from the University of Pennsylvania found that pregnant Black women are more likely to die during the Pandemic than other women.Black women were more worried about the financial burden of the Pandemic than white women were.In the midst of these struggles, pregnant Black women were found to be more self-reliant and were better able to regulate their emotions.Research published in 2020 found that long-term investments in universal health care would go a long way in helping them, along with expanding parental leave and diversifying medical personnel.The policy recommendations are necessary to subvert the crisis of care that Black birthing parents are facing.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;The risk of extremely rare blood clot could be explained by a component of the J&J vaccine&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"A key ingredient in Johnson & Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine could explain the link between the shots and the rare blood clot reported in six patients in the U.S. But some experts say that it could instead prompt an immune response against certain components in the blood that cause clotting.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One person died and another is in a critical condition, according to Dr. Peter Marks, director for the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration.An advisory committee for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will meet Wednesday afternoon to discuss the cases and possible changes to the recommended use of the vaccine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some experts think the key technology used to make the Johnson & Johnson vaccine may play a role in the blood clot cases.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Medicines Agency and the U.K.'s Medicines and healthcare products Regulatory Agency are looking into the link between the vaccine and blood clot incidences.A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine linked the AstraZeneca vaccine to reports of rare blood clot in 11 patients in their 20s, 30s and 40s in Germany and Austria.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been no reported issues with the Covid-19 vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna.The New England Journal of Medicine analysis suggested that the adenoviruses could cause a reaction involving platelets.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When an injury occurs, platelets in the blood are activated, rushing to the site of the injury and forming a clot.But sometimes, platelets can become activated when there is no injury, leading to clot in the blood vessels that can cut off blood flow to key organs such as the heart, Low platelet levels are referred to as Thrombocytopenia.Up to 5 percent of patients who receive the drug will experience a reaction.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In rare instances, the adenoviruses used in the Johnson & Johnson and the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccines might prompt the body to make antibodies similar to what's seen in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.The six patients developed symptoms within 2 weeks of receiving the shot, the amount of time it takes for the body to build the antibodies.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a larger risk of getting Covid-19 disease, and a presumably lesser risk of this blood clotting disorder, according to the FDA.Heparin may be dangerous, and alternative treatments need to be given, according to him.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Covid-19 vaccines have been used on more people than those.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's only when a lot of people are given drugs or vaccines that investigators find rare side effects.The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation owns stock in Johnson & Johnson, but does not work for the company."&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;Fauci says the vaccine pause will last a few days&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious, said Wednesday that he expects the pause on administering the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine to last for days or weeks.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six women between the ages of 18 and 48 developed blood clot after receiving the vaccine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One person died and another is in critical condition, the Food and Drug Administration said.He told people who had gotten the vaccine that it was a very rare event.Fauci said that those who have gotten the vaccine weeks ago can rest easy, but those who have gotten it more recently should watch out for symptoms.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It goes both ways.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;The vaccine pause is bad news for Biden&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The Johnson & Johnson vaccine was about to break through and become an important weapon in the fight against Covid-19.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one-shot vaccine could do what the two-shot Pfizer and Moderna vaccines couldn\'t.It could be distributed to the homeless.The Johnson & Johnson vaccine became the focus of international scrutiny after federal health authorities recommended pausing its use after six women ages 18 to 48 developed a very rare type of blood clot.A review from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration is expected in the coming days, and while White House officials have stressed that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines will help pick up the slack, it\'s the kind of news that some public health experts worry about The U.S. had been averaging more than 3 million shots a day since early April, but vaccination numbers in some states that had been on the upswing were leveling off.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, it plans to switch to Moderna and Pfizer doses for the clinic and for hospital patients being discharged to nursing homes, even though coordinating second shots for such patients can be complicated.She said that time will tell what people choose to do.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and Moderna have supplied 25 million doses of vaccine every week and 28 million will be made available this week, according to a statement by the White House.Pfizer announced Tuesday afternoon that it would boost vaccine production to deliver 10 percent more doses than it had previously promised.There were six reported cases of patients developing blood clot in the brain and low levels of blood platelets.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s 1 in a million.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday\'s announcement was the biggest hurdle in what had been a historic development and distribution process that had encountered few major issues.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health efforts to assure people about the safety of vaccines have led to a decline in hesitancy among some groups.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An assistant professor of medicine at Yale School of Medicine said that the pause should show that federal health authorities are taking safety concerns seriously.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It shows that the mechanisms in place to catch rare events are working, but the pause could become a tool for anti-vaccination activists like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. It is possible that the numbers are much higher than six cases.People are going to talk about how this is an \'experimental\' vaccine and say that it should have never been approved or approved during non-pandemic times.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need platform companies to have a plan for news related to health.Anti-vaccination activists depend on this lack of oversight to exaggerate risks and introduce misinformation into the news cycle.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One person wrote, "So much for those of us opposed to getting the vaccine being conspiracy theorist."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\'m not sure.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People believe that we have a vigorous system that takes adverse events seriously.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;If you got the vaccine, what should you do?&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"Federal officials said that people who got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in the last few weeks shouldn't be worried.Six women ages 18 to 48 developed symptoms after receiving the shots, and they should keep an eye out for warning signs.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday that one patient died and another is in critical condition.Those who received the Johnson & Johnson shot within the last few weeks should be alert for symptoms.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have received the shot recently who experience any of the symptoms should contact their health care provider, officials said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health care providers need to be aware that treatment for this specific type of blood clot is different from what's frequently used for blood clot, according to FDA and CDC officials.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this setting, administration of heparin may be dangerous, and alternative treatments need to be given.There does not appear to be a link between the cases and birth control, Marks said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood clot from birth control medication are typically caused by a different mechanism involving estrogen, while in the cases associated with the vaccine, one current theory is that the body is making antibodies that activated one's platelets.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The headaches can be severe and there can be other neurological signs such as double vision that may accompany it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you didn't have a vaccine, it's unlikely that you have serious problems.Ali Raja, a professor of emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School, said that in patients he has seen with CVST, the headaches is usually worse than past headaches they experienced.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a patient develops a severe headaches within three weeks of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, they need to get checked out by a doctor.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not known how many yearly cases there are of the condition experienced by the six women.There have been more than 180 million doses of the vaccine administered in the U.S. since December.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have vaccine appointments with the other two vaccines should keep their appointments."&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;The FDA and CDC say that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine should be paused&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Federal health authorities recommended Tuesday that providers temporarily stop administering the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine while they investigate a potential link to very rare blood clot.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six women between the ages of 18 and 48 developed blood clot after receiving the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.One person died and another is in critical condition, the Food and Drug Administration said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been no reported issues with the Covid-19 vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schuchat said that the risk is very low for people who got the vaccine more than a month ago.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They developed a type of blood clot in the brain called a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, orCVST, as well as low levels of blood platelets.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually, people with blood clot are treated with a blood thinner called heparin.In rare cases, the immune system reacts to the drug in a way that increases the risk for clotting.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview Tuesday, a 29-year-old woman in Nashville, Tennessee, described a severe reaction to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA said it was unable to confirm or share personally identifiable information because of the rules of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, about a week later, she went to the emergency room with uncontrollable shaking, troubling breathing and a high temperature.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that she went back to the ER because her leg was so swollen that she couldn\'t walk.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No, absolutely not," she said when asked if she had any regrets.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European governments paused the roll out of the Oxford University-AstraZeneca vaccine after a small number of people suffered blood clot.European countries have since resumed administering the shot, but with a messy patchwork of different age restrictions and other guidelines.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation in Europe has divided experts, with some saying that governments could not ignore the possible link, and others saying that the pause may have increased public trust in the vaccine.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;The FDA recommends pausing the J&J vaccine&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;There was a sudden drop in stock futures after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommended a pause in the use of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The S&P 500 was off by 0.3 percent, and the 100 futures were also off.There have been six reported cases of a rare and severe type of blood clot after receiving the vaccine.The J&J vaccine has been administered to more than 6 million people in the U.S. Stock futures had been mostly flat early Tuesday morning before the report, as investors wait for a highly anticipated inflation report.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market has been calm over the past week as Wall Street settled into a lull ahead of the first-quarter earnings season.Corporate news is set to pick up later in the week, with many companies set to report their quarterly results.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;The grocery workers diedTheir families are left to pick up the pieces&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"As panicked shoppers overwhelmed grocery stores in the early days of the Pandemic last year, McMiller's brother, a Walmart worker in Chicago, called to say he was so sick he couldn't stand.Phillip Thomas, 48, had been working at the store for nine years.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She told her brother that she would bring him some food after work.He didn't answer when she called that evening.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She received a call that Thomas had died after testing positive for Covid-19.The plight of grocery workers who risked death to keep the country fed has raised questions about retail labor conditions and the responsibility of corporations in worker deaths from the coronaviruses.According to data from the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, at least 158 grocery workers have died from the Covid-19 virus.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did they help him?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walmart reduced store hours and temporarily suspended or reduced some services, such as food demos, so associates could clean and sanitize, according to the company's website.The company requires masks to shoppers and checks temperatures as people clock in for work.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between March and December of last year, the company gave four separate cash bonuses to associates.Walmart is not immune to the impact of Covid-19, according to a statement from a spokesman.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of these cases are going to be challenging even if the employer was screwed up and didn't have the right procedures.How do we know you got Covid?How do we know you didn't get it at a party? grocery workers have been at the center of the country's battle against the coronaviruses.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Shift Project at the Harvard Kennedy School, 55 percent of grocery workers don't have paid sick leave.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With restaurants closing their doors, droves of people rushed grocery stores for food and essentials, boosting grocery sales across the board.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kroger's total sales were $132 billion last year, compared to $122.3 billion the year before.Walmart said its sales grew to $341 billion in 2020 from $331 billion the year before.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many of these items, we were selling in 2 or 3 hours what we normally sell in 2 or 3 days.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May of last year, the first national grocery chain required masks.It wasn't until July that most major grocery stores required customers to wear a mask.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many hazard pay benefits for workers at Kroger, Walmart and Amazon expired in May.Before the company required employees and shoppers to wear masks, Narvaez was working overtime in the thick of the Pandemic well.After her brother died, she learned that there had been previous coronaviruses cases at the store where he worked.There have been 28 coronaviruses cases and two deaths at the store since March 2020.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention only allows people to list their occupation on coronaviruses tests if they are in the health care field.Brian McGuigan, a Whole Foods Market spokesman, said the company has invested $300 million toward temporary pay increases and bonuses for Whole Foods Market employees, along with enhanced safety procedures.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also offering Whole Foods Market and Amazon workers time off and a benefit for each vaccine dose they receive.She said that Walmart and the OSHA were unwilling to admit that they could be potential Covid hot spots.Jesse Lawder, a spokesman for the agency, said in an email that between March 2020 and April 4, OSHA received about 14,000 coronaviruses-related complaints and opened about 1,900 for inspection.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retailers were told to do what they can.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency is working to re-affirm its commitment to worker safety and reestablish trust that it is advocating for workers.Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh requested the addition of newer analysis.Miller said her mother still cries over the loss of her youngest son.Thomas' funeral offered little peace for the family, as McMiller's older brother has bouts of pain over losing someone she called his twin.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;The parents were at the end of their chain&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"The last thing she needed was the attack on her daughter's school.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she's not teaching special education classes at Buffalo Public Schools, she and her husband are usually making sure their three kids are attending their remote classes.So it hit hard when hackers struck the school of her youngest daughter in early March, the Friday before she was supposed to finally return.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How could this happen?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You wonder if your information is safe.The headaches of Covid are adding to the stress of the school year.Like what else could happen, Buffalo's schools were attacked with malicious code that froze computers and made it impossible for teachers to reach their students who were working remotely because of the Pandemic.School officials canceled remote classes for the day while they figured out what to do.They would need more than a week to resume their class schedule.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The schools in Haverhill, Massachusetts, had to close as recently as Thursday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the FBI focuses more on arrests than on disrupting attacks in the U.S., it's rare for the criminals to face them.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After calling off all remote classes for the day that first Friday, they announced on Sunday that there would be no class on Monday.Then Monday evening, they canceled in-person learning through Wednesday, then Wednesday evening extended that ban for the rest of the week.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no school on Monday.The FBI and the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency don't recommend paying a ransom to hackers because doing so can encourage them to target more victims and there's no guarantee that the hackers will Paying isn't illegal in most cases, but it's still a risk, and sometimes a school will try to pay.The transcript of their conversation was published on the website after negotiations between one gang and the school system broke down.The school has no intention of paying a ransom even when a school catches the attack early.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The identities of their members are known to the FBI and U.S. Secret Service, but they tend to live in Russia or other Eastern European countries that don't extradite their citizens to the U.S. Making progress to address ransomware will require cooperation with international partners.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took a week for everyone to return to school after the first day back after Thanksgiving break.HVA students had no interactions with their teachers for weeks because of the issues with school devices.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every Sunday, parents dropped off their students' previous week of paperwork and picked up a new week's worth.Brooke Abney-Stratton, a mother to an elementary school student and a middle school student in the district, saw her mother hospitalized with Covid-19 in July and The virtual academy kids had no access to email their teachers, even though she had mixed feelings about the program's deployment before the cyberattack.There were no administrators.Abney-Stratton said nothing in a phone interview.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been the worst experience.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never imagined that way."&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;The UK variant is not linked to more severe disease or death&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"People with the U.K. variant of coronaviruses did not experience more severe symptoms and were not at higher risk of death, according to a new study.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study looked at data from last fall in the U.K., shortly after the variant was first detected, to see if it was more deadly.It quickly became the dominant strain in the country.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings add to the understanding of the U.K. variant, known as B.1.1.7, which is circulating widely in other countries.There were Covid-19 patients who were admitted to the University College London Hospital.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists found that 58 percent of the patients were positive for the U.K. variant and 42 percent had a different strain.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers compared the severity of symptoms between the two groups and found that patients with the B.1.1.7 variant were not at increased risk of dying.As the U.K.'s vaccine program was getting underway, the study zeroed in on a time when the U.K. variant was gaining a foothold in London.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frampton said that there is a lot of interesting stuff to look into and that more research is needed.There has been no consensus about the strain's virulence and lethality or whether it causes more severe illness and death.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People over the age of 30 were found to have a 64 percent higher risk of death from the U.K. variant than from earlier strains.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists said the risk of death in this largely unvaccinated population remains low.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe the truth is somewhere in the middle.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is something going on with respect to the B.1.1.7 variant, although there have been some indications that it is affecting young people more than previous strains.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that it can be difficult to separate out other factors that may account for the trend.A variant that is more contagious is likely to mean more cases among children and young people, who previously were not thought to be at risk.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It just means we would expect to see more in younger people because it causes higher viral loads and more spread.In a study published Monday in The Lancet Public Health, it was found that reinfection rates were low.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the number of cases of the U.K. variant exploded in London and southeastern England, only a small number of people reported positive tests.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lead author said that people who had been exposed to a pre-existing variant of the disease were not at higher risk of being reinfecting with the B.1.1.7 variant.Studies have shown that the vaccines currently available offer strong protection against the U.K. variant, and Graham said long-term studies of immunity will offer more clarity about not only the B.1.1.7 strain but also other potentially worrisome variant that could arise.Understanding how that could affect us will be important."&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;Covid disease damage leads to a completely new category of organ transplants&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;In a year when Covid-19 shattered the pleas of so many who prayed for miracles, a Georgia man with two new lungs is among the fortunate.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, only a few US hospitals were willing to take a chance on organ transplants to treat the sickest Covid-19 patients.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too little was known about the long-term effects of the virus and whether patients could survive the surgery.Buchanan was turned down at a hospital in Atlanta, where his wife said doctors told her to end his life.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I told them not to," Buchanan said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took calls to several hospitals, plus a favor from a hometown physician, before Buchanan was accepted at the University of Florida Health Shands Hospital.The transplant landscape has changed six months after he received his new lungs.Covid-19-related transplants are surging as hospitals grapple with a growing subset of patients whose organs are basically destroyed by the virus.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-six more patients eligible for Covid-19-related lung transplants and one eligible for a heart transplant remain on waiting lists, United Network for Organ Sharing data show.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surge in transplants has been fueled largely by the broad reach of the coronaviruses.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands of patients who survived Covid-19 infections are left with damaged organs that are life threatening.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tens of thousands of patients whose organs were otherwise healthy have developed severe, chronic lung disease after having contracted Covid-19.Because it\'s a novel disease, it\'s not yet known how many will need lung transplants.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, the rise in Covid-19-related transplants hasn\'t.More than 107,000 patients are on waiting lists, and about 3,500 need hearts and more than 1,000 need lungs.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organs for transplant are allocated according to complicated metrics, including how long the patients have been waiting, how ill they are, how likely they are to survive with transplants and how close.The goal is to treat the most urgent cases first.The rules don\'t necessarily push Covid-19 patients to the front of the line, experts said, but many become sick enough to require immediate care.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He went to the emergency room in September with severe chest pains and was told his heart was only 10 percent working."Medications didn\'t fix the problem, so doctors offered him several choices, including a mechanical pump to help his heart temporarily."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown, the father of two young daughters, said that he was told that he had a lot of life left in him.Brown, who had hit the gym regularly, was an ideal candidate for a heart transplant.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was healthy except for heart failure.Most Covid-19-related transplants are performed on patients whose lungs have been irreversibly weakened by the disease.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ARDS is caused by fluid leaking into the lungs from Covid-19 survivors.When lung tissue becomes scarred, what was once a scaffold of soft, living cells turns into a stiff mesh that is not capable of exchanging gases.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was in the hospital for 170 days.You tell me if it\'s real or not, such patients are often placed on mechanical ventilation and then extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, in which a machine takes over the functions of the heart and lungs.Not everyone is eligible for a transplant if they become stranded on the machines.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetes or Obesity are pre-existing conditions that can make recovery from surgery difficult.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients younger than 65 who are otherwise healthy and whose lungs won\'t heal on their own are more likely to be transplant candidates.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patients had normal lung function.Mark Buchanan landed in that situation last fall after his entire family caught Covid-19.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jake and Lauren had mild cases.He had to rely on his family and friends to help him when his wife was sick. uchanan survived the transplant and spent three months at the Florida hospital.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was weak after losing more than 70 pounds.He said he couldn\'t brush his teeth or feed himself. uchanan arrived home in January to a parade of 400 neighbors and friends.He is speaking to church groups about his fight for a transplant.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He tried to set them straight by wearing a mask and keeping his distance.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was in the hospital for 170 days. uchanan was one of at least 17 patients to receive Covid-19-related lung transplants at Shands in the past year, the most of any hospital in the country.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dedicated lung unit at Machuca has already focused on patients with complex respiratory conditions.Before Covid, patients with acute respiratory failure were not considered for lung transplantation.I think this expands the limits of what we thought was possible.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;Biden tells business leaders that the US needs to invest in infrastructure&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"President Joe Biden said during a virtual summit meeting with auto executives and other business leaders Monday that the U.S. needs to address an ongoing shortage of semiconductors by investing in its chip infrastructure.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden said that we need to build the infrastructure of today and not repair the one of yesterday.The event was called to address an immediate crisis that has impacted key industries, including consumer electronics, pharmaceuticals and auto manufacturing.The auto industry has had to slow or halt production at plants across the U.S. due to a shortage of new cars and trucks.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vehicle prices that were already on the rise have gone up even more.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding the car or truck of choice can be a challenge with dealer inventories down by about 1 million vehicles, compared to what is normal this time of year, said J.D. Power market research firm.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, he set into motion a 100 day review of supply chain issues covering semiconductors, as well as advanced batteries, pharmaceuticals and other critical goods.Biden's $2 trillion infrastructure proposal would set aside $50 billion for the Semiconductor industry, with an emphasis on expanding U.S. manufacturing GM began a two-week shutdown at its Spring Hill, Tennessee, plant on Monday.Ford plants in Chicago, Flat Rock, Michigan and Kansas City are also closed this week, impacting production of some of the automaker's most profitable products, including the F-150 pickup.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the research firm, manufacturers around the world will lose over one million vehicles in the first quarter.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to AlixPartners, the industry will cut losses to 811,000 vehicles for all of 2020 by increasing output later in the year.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president plans to devote billions from the American Jobs Plan to chip production, and industry officials have already made some suggestions as to what they would like.It is difficult to set up chip plants.They have to meet the same standards as the pharmaceutical industry.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;There are factors that overcame vaccine hesitancy for black Americans&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Richard J. Sylvia Jr. didn\'t get a flu shot, so he wondered why he should take the vaccine.He was aware that Covid-19 was more deadly and contagious than the vaccine, but he was also aware that clinical trials for vaccines always took longer than the trial phase for the vaccine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, 52 percent of Black Americans said they would wait and see before signing up for a vaccine, while only 20 percent wanted the shot as soon as possible, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The share of Black people who were skeptical about the vaccine was higher than the other two groups.In a March survey by KFF, 55 percent of Black respondents said they wanted the vaccine as soon as possible or already had it.Twenty-four percent were still waiting to see the effects of the vaccine.According to the survey, Republicans and white evangelical Christians were the most likely groups to say they won\'t be getting a vaccine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe in vaccines.They work.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I understand where people\'s distrust of the Covid vaccines came from.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unpredictability of the virus was one of the reasons she reversed her feelings on getting the vaccine.I saw how Covid spread when I worked in a hospital.She trusted the Black medical professionals who advocated that the Black community get on board with the vaccinations.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any educated person would say they are unsure because of the speed of the science and the mixed messages that have been shared about the vaccine."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of the virus was what swayed Sylvia, of Ellenwood, Georgia, to change his mind.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both feared for their lives but survived.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sylvia said that one of them spent more than two weeks in the hospital on a respirator.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two weeks before, I had been with him.Sylvia and his wife both received their first shots after sharing his reservations.He said that the reality is that we all need some protection.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have a 7-year-old son who we are trying to protect.The true effect of the vaccines will not be known for a long time.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelvin Lloyd planned to skip taking a vaccine as well.In addition to his distrust of the medical system, Lloyd, 57, had concerns about how a vaccine might interact with multiple sclerosis medication.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lloyd came around on getting the vaccine because of his consultation with his medical team and his faith.He said that he knew that God answered prayers.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists and companies responsible for developing the vaccine should be transparent.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am cleared to take the vaccine after consulting my primary care physician and my neurologist.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I didn\'t have questions before I took it, I would have considered myself careless and irresponsible.The vaccine has provided a comfort that not taking it could not, according to Shackleford.The vaccine has given me peace of mind.&lt;p&gt;

The mourners kept going to the field, demanding answers.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All refused to be quoted ten days after the story was published.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn\'t a mass grave, but a new "covid cemetery" that was arranged because there was a violent increase of dead.He said that the authorities intended to give the information to the families, but he didn\'t explain why that hadn\'t happened.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The burial ground is larger than four soccer fields; when it was first revealed, it had been flattened.For weeks, people came to place crosses where they thought their loved ones were.He was told first that his father was in a spot marked D 24, but days later they said the correct location was D22.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where are you?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would like to see you and give you a hug.&lt;p&gt;

0,2,&lt;p&gt;Experts say that suicidal thoughts are increasing in young kidsIt started before the outbreak&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The youngsters come in with anger or tears in their eyes.Sometimes, they show no emotion at all, like when they announce inside the elementary school counselor\'s office that they want to kill themselves.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her first year, she only had to use it once or twice.Now, she says, about one student a month at her pre-K through fifth grade school tells her that they want to die.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happens when you die?Carter said something.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are difficult conversations at this level.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental health experts say too little attention has been paid to young children, despite growing evidence that more elementary and middle school students are committing suicide.Elementary and middle school students are not included in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\'s biannual youth survey of risky behaviors.More than a dozen mental health professionals, including school counselors, social workers, psychiatrists and suicidologists, said they are seeing more children as young as kindergarten.In the first three quarters of the year, there were 3,503 such visits.The rise in troubled young children is evident around the country.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poverty has an impact too, experts said, as the percentage of children eligible for free or reduced-price lunch jumped to 52 percent from 38 percent over the past two decades.Nearly all of the students at her school meet federal qualifications for free or reduced lunch.Diana Whalen is a professor of Psychiatry at the Washington University School of Medicine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2016 study found that children ages 5 to 11 who die by suicide were more likely to be Black and male, compared to children ages 12 through 14 who killed themselves.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Latino children are three times more likely to be seen in the emergency room for a mental health concern than white children, according to a study published this week.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes services are not that.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They require the parents to do activities beyond their work day, and sometimes parents have multiple jobs or transportation issues.The children she treats may say things like, "What would the world look like without me?" or "It was a mistake to have me."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a lot of parents, they\'re just blown away that they\'re getting this call from a school.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is consistent with research that they will say, "I never would\'ve known my kid is thinking about this stuff."A study last year found that 88 percent of children who tried to kill themselves tried to do so without their parents knowing.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the evening of July 6, she left the house without shoes, but she never argued if her mother said she couldn\'t afford to buy something at a store.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police said her death was a suicide, but her mother said she didn\'t see any signs that she was going to take her own life.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were no clues in the girl\'s diary or text messages, she said, and teachers at school told her they hadn\'t noticed anything unusual.She thought her daughter had acted on an impulse and may not have known the consequences of her actions.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teens are pushing for more mental health support in their high schools.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah became the first state to require elementary schools to offer suicide prevention programs when it passed a law this year.At hearings for the bill, advocates said this would help give elementary students the language to ask for help, pointing out that sometimes young children will say "I have a tummy ache" when it\'s actually the physical manifestations of stress.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, Lifelines created a program for fifth and sixth graders in response to growing demand from school districts.Elementary school teachers used to come to our trainings to learn how to deal with stress and how to ask for help from a trusted adult.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fear that raising the topic with children is risky is one of the myths dispelled by the staff training.Asking someone if they have contemplated suicide doesn\'t increase their chances of doing so.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who have recently had thoughts of suicide, asking the question seems to reduce distress, according to the American Association of Suicidology president.He thinks schools could play a role in screening children\'s mental health, and that doctors could give more information on warning signs.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With so many students, it can feel overwhelming.She is the only school counselor for her 380 elementary students, which is above the recommended ratio of 250:1.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you or someone you know is at risk of suicide, please call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 800-273-8255, text TALK to 741741 or visit Speaking ofSuicide.com/resources for additional resources.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;Biden wants to close offshore tax loopholes&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"According to details released Wednesday by the Treasury Department, the Made in America Tax Plan would raise $2.5 trillion over the next 15 years.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voters support the idea of making huge companies in retail, technology, manufacturing and finance pay more.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent survey by Morning Consult found that 60 percent of American adults think companies should pay more in taxes.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State taxes could push the effective rate even higher, policy experts said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effective tax rate will be lower for a lot of these companies because of deductions.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large discrepancies between income reported to shareholders and that reported to the IRS would be addressed by the president's plan to impose a minimum tax of 15 percent on firms with income of more than $2 billion.The agency estimated that fewer than four dozen companies would be affected by this minimum tax.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act slashed the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent in order to encourage companies to spend more on capital investment and wage gains.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While good news for shareholders, growing concern has been voiced among policymakers and even corporate executives about the deleterious effects of widening income inequality caused, in part, by these changes."&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;One in four adults in the US are fully protected from vaccine-related diseases&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;According to new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, close to 25 percent of adults in the US have been fully vaccineed.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That effort was greatly accelerated with the addition of the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines.States such as Illinois and California have tied their reopening plans to the success of vaccination efforts, which determine when it is safe to resume large gatherings.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He moved the target up to 200 million in March.Since then, the country has regularly administered 2 million to 3 million shots a day.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pace of vaccine production increased after the Biden administration announced an agreement in March.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. is on track to produce hundreds of millions of vaccine doses by summer.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All adults in the U.S. should be eligible for the Covid-19 vaccine by April 19 according to Biden.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;The UK variant is the dominant strain in the US, according to the CDC&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The U.K. variant of the coronaviruses is the most dominant strain in the United States, health officials said Wednesday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a news briefing that the prevalence of "variants of concern" is increasing and that the U.K. variant, known as B.1.1.7, has taken hold across the country.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of cases and hospitalizations are increasing, even as the U.S. is vaccinating an average of nearly 3 million people each day.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New reported infections are increasing, with the most recent seven-day average coming in at more than 63,000 new Covid-19 cases per day, an increase of 2.3 percent from the previous week.At the time, only 76 cases of the B.1.1.7 variant had been identified in 10 states, but the agency projected rapid growth in the months ahead.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common strain of D614G, which was first identified in China in January 2020, spread rapidly through Europe and New York City before eventually becoming the most common strain in the world.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the White House, more than 100 million people in the U.S. have received at least one shot, and vaccine eligibility is poised to open up to all adult Americans by April 19.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are concerns, however, that if the virus continues to spread widely, other strains could emerge that are able to escape the protection caused by vaccines.We can minimize death, disease and misery.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can help save lives in April, May and June if we all do our part.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;The European Regulator says the side effect of the vaccine is very rare&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The European Medicines Agency said that there should be "very rare" side effects of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine has proved to be highly effective, she said at a news briefing, adding that it prevented "severe disease and hospitalization and it is saving lives."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement comes less than a month after theEMA said the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was "safe and effective" to use.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European countries that had put the vaccine on hold resumed administering it after European regulators said it was safe.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press reported Wednesday that Britain has given out more doses of the vaccine than any other country.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because of the different ways the vaccine is being used in different countries, the committee did not conclude that age and gender were factors."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that there was more use in younger age groups in the U.K. than in the E.U. The Johnson & Johnson shot was approved in order to speed up the vaccine\'s introduction.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;"NBC's 'TODAY' show team gets vaccinations"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Five more members of NBC\'s "TODAY" show team happily lined up to receive their first Covid-19 vaccine shots live on the show Wednesday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team was joined by the New York City health commissioner who answered any questions they had.They are hoping to raise awareness about the importance of getting the vaccine and addressing any hesitancy others may be feeling about receiving it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can quickly and easily find out everything you need to know about getting the vaccine in your area through the NBC News "Plan Your Vaccine" tool.This is the first time in human history that a vaccine has been done in a year.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two, three, and four candidates.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s an incredible feat of science and I love that, and we\'re so lucky to be the beneficiaries of that.The five members of the "TODAY" crew were all thankful for the science and the scientists.I think about this in the same way I think about talking to my patients.Listening and understanding people\'s questions are the first things we have to do.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes 14 days after the first shot to get partial protection, and they won\'t be fully protected until 14 days after their second shot.The second dose of the Moderna vaccine is scheduled 28 days after the initial shot, so our anchor team is getting their first dose live on the plaza.The TODAY team urged everyone who is eligible to get the vaccine.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;Hospitals in Brazil are breaking point because of the 4,000 covid deaths a day&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Brazil is bearing the brunt of an alarming surge in Covid-19 cases, with deaths reaching more than 4,000 in a single day on Tuesday and hospitals stretched to breaking point.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Brazilian Health Ministry data, the death toll of 337,000 is second only to the US\'s figure of 562,000.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many blame the president for denying the benefit of wearing masks and questioning the efficacy of vaccines, despite global health advice.Brazil could be back in two or three months, according to Brazilian officials who think the country can return to business as usual.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surge in deaths across the globe serve as a grim reminder that despite successful vaccination roll-outs.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rowland Kao, a professor of veterinary epidemiology and data science at the University of Edinburgh, said that although vaccines and social restrictions were working, "we\'re definitely not on top."He said it would require a "balancing act" for countries to get moving again.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said it would be a game of can you keep it out long enough to develop boosters.It takes one person to cross a border.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India reported a record 115,736 new cases on Wednesday, a 13-fold increase in just over two months.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency reported 668 new cases on Tuesday, the highest level since January.The medical system is very tight.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;"Latinos are offered billions by Biden's Covid reliefWill they claim it?"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The Ramirez family, who own a restaurant, was helped by Tom Castro by helping them find more than $20,000 to start.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Castro feared someLatino households might miss out on money coming to them in the latest pandemic relief package, so he started by helping the Ramirez family find more than $20,000 to start There are rules for forgiveness of the loan.The husband and wife have four children under the age of 18 and preferred not to be interviewed.They were skeptical when they met Castro.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They said, "This is a loan, right?"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ramirez family raised other concerns.They haven\'t filed their taxes yet.They thought the aid was for people on food stamps.Many immigrant families stopped using public benefits or steered clear of them, even if they were eligible for them, fearing that the Trump administration policy changes might jeopardize their futures in the country.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total could be more than $60 billion if all Latinos claimed what they are entitled to, he said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Castro said that many Latino families don\'t have the luxury of keeping their money in savings or 401(k) accounts.They will spend every penny because they need to, and they will pay taxes, sales taxes and help create jobs, he said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three Ramirez children are eligible for another $3,000, and their child under 6 is eligible for $3,600, if they are married and earn less than $150,000.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that\'s how they do it, the monthly allotments for the children would come through a reworking of the child tax credit.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the White House, 85% of Americans will get some sort of payment, which will be a big help for a woman who worked as Castro\'s assistant before she left for health reasons.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and her children are both legal permanent residents.Gonzalez said the couple had to let go of three employees of their small landscaping business.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When one of their business trucks broke down, they used the truck their son had bought with savings from Christmas and birthday gifts.Biden extended the deadline to apply for paycheck protection loans to May 31 because they couldn\'t get through the red tape.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gonzalez said she and her husband will apply again.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that people have painted Latinos as people with their hand out.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juan Proao is the founder of Plus Three, a technology company that helps nonprofits.The challenge is to ensure that Latinos are educated about what they are entitled to, despite cultural hesitation and ways they may disqualify themselves.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Latino-owned businesses received the grants.The Paycheck Protection Program is something the chamber is trying to help businesses with.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is part of the community.Castro suggested that college students, churches, Latino groups and employers work together to make sure that Latinos get the money they are due.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine is available, the money is available, but people have to use it or it doesn\'t work.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;The human rights champion says that they failed the test&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"The French human rights expert, Agns Callamard, is best known for her investigation into the killing of Saudi journalist, and has made a career uncovering extrajudicial killings.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wide-ranging report took particular aim at governments inMyanmar and Russia, among others, but also critiqued the use of coronavirus-related police powers in places like Britain and the United States against protesters.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a global community, we failed the test that Covid-19 represented.She concluded that there was credible evidence that the killing of the journalist was state-sanctioned.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She concluded that the U.S. drone strike that killed Qasem Soleimani was illegal.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said she will no longer lead her own investigations, but will continue to call out human rights.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The epidemic exposed a lot.She said that ending it will expose even more wealthy and powerful nations which have purchased more vaccines than they need.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the name of what?In the name of profit and in the name of greed, Callamard said, referring to the European Union and U.S. decision to block a proposal to relax intellectual property restrictions on patents related to coronavirus treatments and vaccines.Callamard wrote before Monday's announcement that the global taxation system had produced more winners thanlosers.It's a way of making sure that it isn't those who have the least who are asked to give the most."&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;"Pandemic's uncertain future is highlighted by CDC's messaging problem"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The CDC and its director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, have been the subject of growing criticism over statements and guidance that have been revised or walked back.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is something of a dilemma for the U.S. Millions of Americans are getting vaccinations, and state and local governments are relaxing restrictions.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health experts worry about the possibility of a fourth surge as case numbers rise in parts of the country.Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr is a professor of epidemiology and medicine at Columbia University."But we\'re in a situation where the message is very complex."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She suggested in an interview with MSNBC that people who have beenvaccinated don\'t carry the virus.It\'s too soon to know what effect the vaccines have on transmission, said many researchers.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few days later, the CDC walked back her statement.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In light of the steady rise in case numbers and the fact that most of the U.S. population is still unvaccinated, Walensky said, "I would advocate against general travel overall."The CDC is being criticized at a shaky time as it tries to rebuild trust that has eroded over the past year, largely because of political interference from the Trump administration.As the situation changes, it\'s hard to address the nuances of public health guidance.It depends on the context, the circumstance, the individual, and the geography.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC and the World Health Organization reversed course on recommendations for people to wear masks in public.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The events of the past year have laid bare how important it is for the CDC and public health professionals to be open about where the science stands and to manage people.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When infections in some states threaten to wipe out hard-fought gains to stem the virus\'s spread, the balance is especially important.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;The latest Covid-19 surge is being driven by young people&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;They\'re young, restless, and across the United States they\'re driving the latest wave of Covid-19 cases.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We\'re seeing more and more young people get into serious trouble, such as severe disease, requiring hospitalization and occasionally even tragic deaths in quite young people."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, Walensky said, "many outbreaks in young people are related to youth sports and extracurricular activities that involve their parents."In states like Florida, Pennsylvania and Maryland, the number of younger people in hospital Covid-19 wards is on the rise.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spread of Covid-19 among nongeriatrics is more pronounced in Michigan, which leads the nation in hospitalizations among younger, unvaccinated people.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s not just because the state is grappling with the spread of highly infectious Covid-19 variant that\'s second only to Florida.When people are eating and not wearing masks, it is happening.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michigan public health experts have been urging the governor to keep the mask mandate and other restrictions in place, but an advocacy group for student athletes and their parents called "Let Them Play" has sued the director of the state.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They think it is a hoax.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michigan has seen some of the fiercest resistance to the restrictions on the spread of the H1N1 strain, and the target of the right-wing is a Democrat.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;Mild Covid is what most children with rare and serious inflammatory illness have&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"Most children with a serious inflammatory illness linked to the coronaviruses had initial Covid-19 with no symptoms or only mild ones, new U.S. research shows.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included a number of cases that were reported to the CDC.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most were in kids younger than 15 but the study included up to age 20.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upticks in cases have occurred two to five weeks after Covid-19 peaks and have followed the spread of initial infections from urban to rural areas.The CDC reported 3,185 cases through March 29 and included 36 deaths.It is not known how many U.S. children have developed the illness since the study ended.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some cases, especially those that follow silent infections, may be mistaken for Kawasaki disease, a rare condition that can cause red skin, swelling and heart problems.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inflammatory condition can cause children to become very sick very quickly, but most of them respond well to treatment and get completely better.The CDC found that the most common symptoms in children were infections.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least half of the affected kids had abdominal pain, vomiting, and red skin rash.More than one-third had heart inflammation or other cardiac involvement.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children up to age 4 are less likely to require intensive care than older children."&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;Oxford is waiting for more data on blood clot issues&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The University of Oxford said on Tuesday it had paused a small U.K. trial testing the Covid-19 vaccine it developed with AstraZeneca in children and teenagers, as it waits for more data on rare blood clotting issues in adults who received the shot.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;California will lift most restrictions on June 15&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"The mask mandate in the nation's most populated state will remain after June 15, when California plans to lift most coronaviruses restrictions.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement comes as states across the country have lifted health restrictions as more people get vaccinations.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California was the first state to institute a statewide stay-at- home order last spring, as well as adopting a complex, color-coded tier system that dictated which businesses could open and at what capacity depending on how widespread the virus was in a county.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Californians can go to the beach under certain circumstances, but the announcement signals an end date to more than a year of isolation.California has resisted reopening too quickly while other states have pushed ahead.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most capacity limits will be lifted, although large-scale indoor events, such as conventions, will be allowed only with testing or vaccination verification requirements.Businesses and others have plenty of time to prepare."&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;What can you do after your first Covid vaccine dose?&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The US hit a new high for the number of daily Covid-19 vaccinations on Saturday.Over the last few weeks, the daily average of vaccinations has risen to more than 3 million, which means more people are getting a Covid-19 vaccine every day.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the majority, who will get either the Pfizer-BioNTech or the Moderna vaccine, it\'s just the first dose; in three to four weeks, they\'ll return for a second.For the two other vaccines available in the U.S., it\'s essential that people who get a two-dose vaccine shot go back for the second to be fully protected, experts say.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They should sit tight until they have completed their vaccine series.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government\'s leading infectious disease expert, qualified the findings, saying, "It is somewhat of a tenuous 80."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you see it again, that\'s a signal that this is something worth dedicating a lot of energy to and making a strong memory response against."The single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine, on the other hand, leads to a similarly robust immune response after just one dose.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that the side effects that you face are worth having that strong immune response that is going to protect you from the actual virus.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;"The governor of Texas banned government-mandated 'vaccine passports'"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"In a video announcement, Abbott said that Texans are returning to normalcy as vaccination efforts increase and hailed the state for administering.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abbott said that vaccinations should be done without treading on Texans' personal freedoms.The order states that no government agency can mandate an individual receive a Covid-19.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also states that any institution, public or private, that receives government funds can't deny someone for failing to provide proof of vaccine.According to the U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services, immigrants seeking permanent residency in the U.S. are required to provide proof of vaccination for certain diseases."&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;The Texas Rangers will have a full house for their home opener&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;More than 30,000 people attended the Texas Rangers home opener Monday against the Toronto Blue Jays, in the first major, full-capacity sporting event in the US in more than a year.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rangers insisted it was safe to host so many fans, citing in-person events that have been held at Globe Life since May.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The customer service staff and security have a lot of experience handling large gatherings.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was important for the team to take season subscribers at the home opener, as all Rangers ticket buyers and fans are important to us.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;"Some 'vaccine fairies' are helping vulnerable Americans book appointments"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, when the Covid-19 vaccines first started being distributed, the states and drug store chains set up websites to book appointments that were so glitchy and so difficult to use that many people were plunged into despair.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of the 126 appointments she has been able to book were in honor of her grandmother Luz Maria Sosa, who died last April from the coronaviruses.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She would have wanted me to help other people, because she was watching her parents struggle to get help for her brother with Down syndrome.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They said word-of-mouth is how most people find them.There are organized groups of vaccination volunteers online, including a nonprofit called "Vaccine Fairy" that claims to have secured nearly 8,000 appointments nationwide.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Harvard, Massachusetts, which is about 30 miles west of the famous Ivy League university, a group of women who call themselves the "Vaccine Fairy brigade" have booked about 750 appointments since February, the local newspaper, The Harvard Press, reported.She said that the need for Vaccine Fairies to assist older adults with vaccination appointments is a clear indicator of our lack of public health infrastructure.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that the federal and state governments did not budget for and hire workers to assist individuals with access to vaccine was a huge oversight.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fairies are praised for their altruism while the government is blamed for a lack of support for older adults.The most vulnerable Americans have been preyed upon by identity thieves.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From coast to coast, police departments have warned people to be careful about giving out their personal information.In a subsequent interview with NBC News, she said she felt it necessary to speak out.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is desperation out there.Beltran, a supervisor of investigations for the New Jersey Child Protective Services, said she didn\'t set out to be a vaccine fairy.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I work for the state and it was difficult to navigate the site.I realized that it would be difficult for an older person who doesn\'t know how to use a computer or someone who doesn\'t speak good English.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started scheduling appointments for my family after becoming savvy with the system.Even for state employees, it has been hard to get an appointment, so she has been helping some of them.When the new appointments are posted, she takes a nap and then gets up at 2 a.m. to schedule them.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beltran said she had a mild case of Covid-19 in November and so did her mother and daughter.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which requires just one shot, is the top choice for many of the people she hears from.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She branched out to make appointments in Chicago because friends were complaining about how hard it was to find a shot.I began to hear from friends.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got to know the quirks of the various websites, and a lot of it is just knowing when the new The game of finding a slot is easier for people who grew up with computers.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karen White of Massachusetts said she learned first-hand how hard it was to make an appointment when she secured one for herself and for her husband this year.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White said she has been able to get 35 vaccine appointments for both family and friends because she\'s not afraid of computers and made it her mission to learn how to navigate the website.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\'m ready when they drop.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been able to make five or six appointments.Sometimes it is just two.Beltran said that when she is on the hunt for appointments, she often thinks about her grandmother, who died at an awful time.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took several weeks for her to be cremated.Mueller, who works in child care, said helping others has given her a lift, as well, during the Pandemic.We have learned a lot about community, about being part of a community, and about being forgotten.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;The UK economy reopens as Boris Johnson launches mass testing&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday that everyone in England will be able to take a Covid-19 test twice a week.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told Sky News that people were doing the right thing and that the increased testing would help health officials track the Pandemic.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Financial Times, Johnson was not expected to set out a specific time frame for the recovery.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite increased testing, a reopening of schools in March has not yet led to a spike in cases.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;"Office buildings are open againSome employees don't want to come back"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;She woke up anxious after returning to her office for the first time since the beginning of the Pandemic.Her stomach was not feeling well.One of the millions of employees across the country who hastily made the transition to remote work last spring wasayne-Lomon, 38, of Roslindale, Massachusetts.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day was full of reminders of how much has changed since she was last in her office.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she arrived on her floor, she saw a familiar sight, as everyone wore masks, elevators had capacity limits, and traffic flow signs were posted to reduce crowding in corridors.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that it was nice to see her co-workers and that she had to stop herself from hugging them.It was like, "Hey, look at us, we\'re all still people!"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every employee is eager to return to an office that has been closed.With concerns from health to rusty social skills to preserving the new work-life balance that some discovered when their commute disappeared, many are reluctant to give up their remote work settings.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now we\'re at this point where it\'s like, \'I\'ve lost a lot this year, but what have I gained?\' I think, in particular when it comes to work, there\'s been a lot of gains.\' In an otherwise challenging year, the ability to throw in a load of laundry while they work, spend more time with family or make more home-cooked meals has been a silver lining.Not driving into work has saved her mileage on her car and money on gas, and it has given her the opportunity to schedule doctors\' and dentists\' appointments more easily after work, as well as take her dog for a walk on her lunch break.Her visits to work have felt overstimulating compared to the solitude of working in her bedroom.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many companies have already welcomed workers back.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As more people get vaccinations, the number of employees going into their offices is expected to increase.In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio recently announced a target date of May 3 for about 80,000 municipal office workers to return to their offices.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the country, Microsoft has begun to bring back some employees.Target Corp., anticipating a permanent combination of hybrid and in-office work, has downsized its corporate office space by a third.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination status did not affect that, as 48 percent of those who have already been vaccine recipients say they are uncomfortable with in-person interactions.We don\'t know how effective they are.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that we don\'t have vaccines for children.Safety in the workplace is of particular concern.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a survey of 1,000 adults conducted in February by the workplace technology company Envoy, 66 percent of employees said they were worried about their health in returning to the workplace.Those who were already prone to anxiety may have struggled more during the Pandemic, and those who were not may have experienced anxiety for the first time in the past year.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental health challenges have been posed by the Pandemic.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the proportion of adults with symptoms of an anxiety or depression disorder increased from August to February.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employers and employees can take steps to reduce anxiety.He said that employers should be flexible at the start in terms of expectations, meaning those who were most closely touched by this.It can be challenging."After such an extended period of not seeing one another, everyone should be prepared for interactions to feel a little stilted at first, Wright said."&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;"Do you need a test to find out if you're allergic to the vaccine?"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Even though Giunta was desperate to get the vaccine, she had two severe allergic reactions.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two ingredients in the Covid-19 vaccines, polyethylene glycol and polysorbate 80, have been suggested as possible culprits in anaphylactic reactions related to Covid-19 vaccines.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A life-threatening allergic reaction is called anaphylaxis.Some allergy clinics across the U.S. have begun to highlight that they are able to test patients for allergies to those ingredients, but those tests may be a waste of time and resources.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna use polysorbate 80 in their vaccines as a protective coating for messenger RNA, bits of genetic code used to teach cells how to recognize and fight the virus that causes Covid-19.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s used to make products creamy.It\'s also an ingredient in the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine, though no allergic reactions have been reported in Johnson & Johnson vaccine recipients to date.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that allergic reactions to the Covid-19 vaccine have occurred at a rate of 2 to 5 people per million vaccinations in the United States.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly a third of those who took part in a recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey said they would rather wait and see what happens to others who get the vaccine before rolling up their own sleeves.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tests are done by scratching a tiny amount of the substance in question into a person\'s skin and watching for a reaction.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore said that most people with allergies don\'t need to worry about reactions to Co. She said allergy tests for polysorbate 80 should only be used for people with a history of allergic reactions.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of the public don\'t have to worry about getting a vaccine if they have a positive test.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I\'m not advocating that everyone should be skin-tested before getting the vaccine, absolutely not," said Charlot, who works at Allergy and Asthma Care of Brooklyn.None of the allergy tests Charlot has done for polysorbate 80 has come back positive.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The harm in relying on such testing would be to have someone avoid a vaccine.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;A man was arrested at a Disney resort in Florida&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"A man who was arrested after refusing a temperature screening at Disney Springs in Florida told authorities that he couldn't be told to leave because he had spent $15,000 on his vacation.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the police report, the security manager at Disney Springs told Sills he was no longer welcome at the park after he yelled at him.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All he had to do was check his temperature.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one point in the video, Sills asked if authorities could take his temperature before forcing him to leave.Someone said that they would do it in jail.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to court records, Sills pleaded not guilty to a charge of being a Disney stockholder.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His attorney, Michael Zmijewski, declined to comment."&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;There are five dormitories at the University of Connecticut&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The main campus of the University of Connecticut was put under yellow restrictions after 35 students tested positive for Covid-19, and officials blamed March parties for the outbreak.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All dorm dwellers will have to stay on campus through spring break, which is scheduled for the week of April 11, Daugherty said.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;A case of Indian coronaviruses has been found in the US&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"At least one case of a new coronaviruses variant first detected in India in Northern California has been found by researchers.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that the variant was found in a patient from the San Francisco Bay Area.The cases in India started to increase through the winter after decreasing since September.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 47,000 new infections were detected in a single day in March, including hundreds of deaths, according to the AP.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covid-19 rates have been decreasing across California this spring following a deadly winter surge that started in late November and didn't ease up until after the new year.The drop in cases has allowed some of the state's most populous counties, including Los Angeles, to begin relaxing restrictions and gradually reopen the economy."&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;Almost a third of the country has gotten at least one dose of Covid vaccine&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;More than 100,000,000 Americans have received at least one dose of vaccine, according to the federal government.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;"The governor of Florida banned the state from issuing 'vaccine passports'"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Government entities in Florida are not allowed to issue vaccine passports or other standardized documentation for the purpose of certifying.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Legislature is working on making permanent these protections for Floridians and I look forward to signing them into law soon.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Legislature is working on making permanent these protections and I will sign them into law soon.The order said that vaccine records are private and should not be shared by the government.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is completely unacceptable for either the government or the private sector to impose upon you the requirement that you show proof of vaccine to just simply participate in normal society, he said.More than 6 million vaccine doses have been administered in Florida.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;A Latina volunteer in Texas helped hundreds of people get vaccines&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;In less than a month, she registered over 600 people to get Covid-19 vaccine appointments.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her volunteer initiative began when she took it upon herself to register her relatives because she was a tech savvy one in her family.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Texas resident figured that if her Latino family had trouble finding appointments, she could register others who might have difficulty doing so, such as native Spanish speakers, the elderly or people with disabilities.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could offer this."I\'ve been fortunate enough to be able to catch these appointments for them, and I just have to thank my fast thumbs and super speed internet, which I know many people don\'t have," she said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sitting in her living room on her phone, she uses a form she created at the beginning of March to schedule her appointments.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of her applicants are Latino, which isn\'t surprising given they account for the majority of the population in the Rio Grande Valley, a region on the southern border of Texas above Mexico.Sometimes an application was signed up by a relative who didn\'t know about the job, so they were surprised or taken aback when she would inform them of their appointment.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She put a brief bio on her form to assure people she was trustworthy.According to many experts, the best way to get vaccines to hard to reach communities is through trusted sources.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People soliciting money or personal identification information to make appointments that turn out to be fake have been warned by the CDC and government officials.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main barrier for residents has been the limited appointment times.Most residents go to vaccination sites where they can get wristbands on a first-come, first-served basis, but they have to wait in line for hours.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they\'re turned away, it\'s disappointing.They often have to take time off from work and transportation requires planning out the logistics, even more difficult if they don\'t own a car, she said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once she finds one that matches their distance preference and availability, she texts or calls them in Spanish, where she often hears them.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of applicants comes in waves and when asked about the specific number of people she\'s registered, she lost count.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She expects that number to change by next week and though she doesn\'t see this going on for the rest of the year, she\'s happy to keep doing it.Over 105,000 Covid-19 confirmed cases have been reported in the Rio Grande Valley since March 2020.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though Texas has the second-highest number of confirmed cases in the country, Gov. Greg Abbott lifted the state\'s mask mandate and withdrew most of his Covid.The decision has led to tensions with some local governments, including a high-profile clash after the state\'s attorney general sued Austin officials for refusing to enforce the governor\'s order to end the mask mandate.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was eligible due to a chronic condition and was able to schedule an appointment in early March, though it was an hour away from her home.She hopes to be able to drive people to their vaccine appointments if transportation is a barrier for them.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wants other people to have the same sense of security.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel good and I can share that with the people I\'m helping.I hope they feel that relief once they get that vaccine, too," she said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They\'re taking the next step to protect themselves.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;WHO officials say that some states in Brazil are in critical condition&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"There is a very serious situation going on in Brazil right now, where we have, and a number of states are in critical condition.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country currently accounts for about a quarter of COVID-19 daily deaths worldwide, more than any other country, and its vaccination efforts have been hampered by a lack of shots.Sao Paulo, the country's biggest city, on Thursday sped up efforts to empty old graves.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil has suffered its worse coronaviruses wave since the outbreak began over a year ago, and it has taken on new importance."&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;"Younger Latino men are Covid's biggest victims"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Melanie Hoyos received news that she had a job as an animal technician.She wished she\'d called her dad to tell him she got the job.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diego Hoyos, who was 49, was one of thousands of Hispanics who have died in New Jersey from the Covid-19 virus.Hispanic men account for nearly half of all confirmed coronaviruses deaths among adults under 50, even though they make up just 12 percent of the population, according to a WNYC/Gothamist analysis.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tolentino, a firefighter and emergency medical technician in Passaic, was known to everyone for driving the ambulance or attending church and events around the city, said his sister.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you lose a generation of young parents, the psychological and economic impact and trauma can be overstated, according to a public health professor."I think it\'s going to be something we\'re going to be grappling with for quite a long time, because we have not seen something this stark happen all at once."Valdez lost her father, Israel Tolentino, 55, to Covid-19.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that the deaths of her father and brother were very hard on Israel III.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My sister-in-law had to talk to my nephew and tell him not to worry.He doesn\'t have to worry about anything since he is the only male in the house.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been difficult, she said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deaths of young Latino men in New Jersey give a glimpse into bleaker nationwide statistics.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loss of young Latino lives, particularly those of people in their 30s and 40s, is three times that of the country\'s white population, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Latinos are among the youngest racial or ethnic groups in the country, with a median age of 30.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Latinos are more likely to work in front-line jobs, and they have the highest uninsured rates of any racial or ethnic group in the U.S. Diego Hoyos didn\'t get to celebrate his 25th wedding anniversary that summer or his 50th birthday in November, he never got to see his oldest daughter, who was born in.He met his wife in New York and they moved to New Jersey, where he worked many jobs to make ends meet.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He worked in construction and drove trucks.She said her father didn\'t have a will and was always trying to send money back home.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did not have a 401(k).He had no savings.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She holds on to a happy memory, the first time she saw her father in two years.Hoyos\' oldest daughter, Elizabeth, was able to come to the U.S. and they went to Disney World.It was the happiest I had ever seen him.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;Workers in Cuba are reinventing themselves because of the decline in tourism&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Cuba closed its borders a year ago on April 1 after the coronaviruses hit, which caused Carlosnchez to stop serenading tourists in Old Havana.Now the 57-year-old ekes out a living repairing fans.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The global vaccination drive is sparking hopes worldwide of a tourism rebirth this summer, yet Cubans like Sanchez are not holding their breath as the Caribbean island goes through its worst outbreak yet and enforces tight travel and lockdown A reopening in November led to a surge in infections, prompting authorities to reduce flights and tighten up restrictions.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;People can travel in the US without being tested&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Friday that people who are fully vaccined against Covid-19 can travel in the U.S., as long as they remain masked on planes, buses and trains.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People are making decisions on their own.American Airlines reported Monday that the company's bookings have jumped to 90 percent of what they were before the outbreak.The CDC does not recommend travel at this time due to the rising number of cases.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who have received both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna shots or one shot of the single-dose vaccine from Johnson & Johnson may be able to resume normal activity.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No U.S. airlines currently require proof of vaccine to travel, though there are exceptions.Some countries may require a negative Covid-19 test for entry.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC recommends that people test negative before returning to the U.S., and that they wear masks and wash their hands frequently.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early March, the agency said they may safely gather with small groups from other households, even if those people have not yet had their shots."&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;Employees could be going back to work sooner than they think&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"The days of working from home may be numbered, as some companies are dumping office space and others are ramping up their return-to-work plans.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that remote work was here to stay was perpetuated by that.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You get thevaccines for all laid in your lap.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Cappelli, director of the Center for Human Resources at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, said that things will retreat back to normal within a year.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unlikely that employers will require employees to get vaccinations unless they work in high-risk environments.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only 10 percent of employers think vaccines should be compulsory.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same may be true for Covid vaccines."&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;The US economy added over a million jobs in March&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The labor market is finally working its way back to pre-pandemic norms as the number of vaccinations continues to rise, as evidenced by the fact that the unemployment rate fell to 6 percent last month.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The totals for January and February were revised upward by 67,000 and 89,000, respectively.All adults in many states will be eligible for the vaccine in the next few months.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means more permanent, widespread reopening can occur across the board and really start to work to right the ship of the economy.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That\'s going to enable us to reopen the economy sooner than might have been expected."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Yelena Maleyev, an economist at Grant Thornton, the rescue plan will help those hardest hit by the recession to get back on their feet.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The economy would need to add 950,000 jobs a month for the next 10 months to return to pre-pandemic levels.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we add in jobs that should have been created over that time to absorb new workers, we\'re facing a jobs shortfall today of nearly 12 million jobs," said Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;The US is losing at vaccine diplomacy to Russia and China&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;It didn\'t take long for the seeds of Russia\'s vaccine diplomacy in South America to show green shoots, after Moscow sold 5.2 million doses of its Sputnik V vaccine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The offer was to support Beijing\'s "core interests" and oppose interference in its internal affairs, which it denies.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas Shannon, the former U.S. undersecretary of state for political affairs, said that the United States used to be the go-to country for major health disasters.Donald Trump, who was ambassador to Brazil from 2010 to 2013, said that pulling itself off the playing field was very disconcerting.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Campbell was the U.S. ambassador to Nigeria from 2004 to 2007.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both countries deny exporting vaccines for diplomatic gain.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This idea is " extremely narrow-minded," said a spokesman for the Chinese People\'s Political Consultative Conference.The president of China has vowed to make vaccines a "global public good" and the Kremlin spokesman has said that Russia only believes that there should be as many doses of vaccines as possible.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have been approved by dozens of regulators, and China has sent 118 million vaccine doses to 49 countries.The West\'s vaccine nationalism has created a vacuum in which lower- and middle-income countries have been unable to get access.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of Chinese and Russian vaccine doses have gone where Western powers and Russia have been competing for years for more influence, according to the global forecasting director at the Economist Intelligence Unit.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It ordered tens of millions of doses from a number of companies.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the man on the street" in African countries using the vaccines, "Russia and China become more attractive as possible models for going forward", said Campbell, the former ambassador to Nigeria.Shannon said that it will help increase the attractiveness of authoritarian forms of government at the expense of more democratic forms of government.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Eastern Europe, use of Chinese and Russian shots allowed Serbia and Hungary to soar ahead of neighbors struggling with choke Western supplies.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It isdwarfed in scale by Russian arms sales, for example, or China\'s Belt and Road infrastructure plan.She said it was only accelerated ongoing shifts.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China has two advantages Western countries don\'t.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has less need to keep vaccines at home after crushing its outbreak.It would be political suicide for Biden to say, "My dear fellow Americans, I\'m going to send millions of vaccines to South America or Africa just because we need to compete with Russia and China."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He gave $4 billion to COVAX, a vaccine-sharing plan, and he has urged allies to give their surpluses to poorer countries.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has bought hundreds of millions of shots for American arms and looked to donate to developing countries only once every U.S. adult has been offered a vaccine.I think we\'ve lost the game.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;The Covid surge in New Jersey is getting worse&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"If the wave of Covid-19 infections battering the state gets worse, the federal government doesn't appear to be making any immediate move to send extra vaccine doses.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone will be able to get a vaccine when there is enough supply from the federal government.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Biden administration official said that 90 percent of people in the U.S. will be within 5 miles of a vaccine site.The government is opening a mass vaccine site in Newark this week that can give up to 6,000 vaccine doses a day.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murphy said the current wave will peak in mid-April with about 5,500 new infections and 2,700 hospitalizations a day.By the end of July, the numbers in this model would fall to daily case counts of 2,500 and 1,200 hospitalizations.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was less than three months ago that New Jersey was one of the hardest hit states in the Pandemic.New Jersey's newest Covid-19 wave began to pick up after Murphy, under pressure.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of young people being hospitalized increased in March due to the relaxation of the state and municipal polices.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Jersey is a crowded state and that is a good thing.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The population density is high.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Jersey prioritized vaccinations for older people and nursing home residents because their rates of infections and death are going down.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People in New Jersey were lulled into a false sense of security when the vaccine began, as has been the case across the country.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They think we are safe because so many people are vaccine free.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are not safe.We have not yet reached herd immunity, and it takes a while for the vaccines to be effective."&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;"Economists say Friday's jobs report could be hot"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"The government's monthly employment report is expected to show a big jump in new jobs added in March.The unemployment rate is expected to decrease from 6.2 percent in February to 6 percent in the March report.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is high demand for labor.Airlines, bars and restaurants are open again.The weather has turned warm, and economic impact checks will give the economy a boost.An increase in weekly initial jobless claims, which rose to 719,000 from a downwardly revised 658,000, was greater than the 675,000 expected, but failed to shake economists' consensus that the labor market is on the right track.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The economy is expected to grow by 1M in April, 2M in May and 2M in June.By the beginning of April 2020, it was clear that the labor market would be badly affected by the Pandemic.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The economy lost 701,000 jobs in March, and the unemployment rate hit 4%.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unemployment rate hit a post-Great Depression high of 14.7% in April after a record-breaking loss of 20.5 million jobs.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of businesses that have gone under.With a deficit of nearly 10 million jobs still remaining, even today's optimism is tempered with an acknowledgement that restoring the damage wrought by Covid-19 is a marathon and not a sprint.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are jobs that won't come back.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some industries will not be the same as others.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift from brick-and-mortar shopping to e-commerce has been a sea change for retail operations.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that it will take time for economic activity to rebound even after households and businesses are no longer affected by the Pandemic.He said it would take longer to make full recovery.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The summer is reopening."&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;One vaccine batches was discarded due to production issues&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"The issue will not affect the Biden administration's timetable to have enough vaccine doses for the U.S. adult population by the end of May.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The active ingredient at Emergent BioSolutions did not meet quality standards and was never advanced to the filling and finishing stages of the manufacturing process.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA is aware of the situation and has urged Johnson & Johnson to take full control of it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions about a firm's manufacturing facilities should be directed to that firm.Emergent BioSolutions said in a statement that there are rigorous quality checks throughout their vaccine manufacturing processes.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson & Johnson said it would provide additional experts in manufacturing, technical operations and quality to be on-site at Emergent to supervise, direct and support all manufacturing of its vaccine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has promised to deliver 100 million doses by the end of May, but the delivery numbers may be different due to a lag in reporting to the CDC."&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;The FDA allows rapid at- home Covid-19 tests&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Several over-the-counter Covid-19 tests were authorized Thursday by the Food and Drug Administration for use without a prescription, offering a way for schools, workplaces and other groups to conduct rapid screening.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the FDA, rapid tests will be especially useful for serial testing, which involves "testing the same individual multiple times within a few days, and can increase chances of detecting asymptomatic infection that might not always show up with a single test."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antigen tests can detect fragments of viral proteins that cause an immune response.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main method of screening for Covid-19 has been the testing of the polymerase chain reaction.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mina said that frequent testing with rapid results is important because anyone can be exposed to this virus and not realize it until after they have become infectious.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giving people the tools to know that they are infectious in real-time is the best way to combat spread.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;Cuba\'s medical equipment is "technological sovereignty" in the Covid fight&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Cuba\'s vaccine candidates have made headlines around the world.In a bid to achieve "technological sovereignty" during the Pandemic, the production of medical gear such as ventilators and CT scans for the treatment of COVID-19 patients is less well-known.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cuba has one of the lowest death rates per capita in the world at 423.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company\'s most advanced candidate, called Sovereignty 2, is currently in phase three trials and is expected to be ready for use by the end of the year.&lt;p&gt;

0,2,&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and BioNTech say trials show that the Covid vaccine works against the South African variant&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The drugmakers said in a statement that their vaccine is effective against a coronaviruses variant that first emerged in South Africa, which some experts worry might evade existing shots.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They plan to share the results with regulators around the world and to submit the data for peer review.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 91.3 percent degree of efficacy was achieved by 77 cases of Covid-19 that were given the vaccine, according to a statement issued in a non-peer-reviewed news release.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the latest figures from the CDC, there have been over 300 cases of the strain in the US.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They will be requesting emergency use authorization for children ages 6 months to 11 years.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first dose was administered last week.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;The introverted, productive and Jeff Bezos are some of the winners&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Since the Covid-19 lockdowns began, I have suspected that everyone else has had a better experience than me.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know this is not true.Some people will not be able to stop reminiscing about the past year as we slowly emerge from our collective Covid-19 hibernation.In order to give some insight into why these people aren\'t as excited as the rest of us, I\'ve divided them into seven "lockdown success" categories.I tried to understand the psychology of toilet paper hoarding, wondering how the tigers at the Bronx Zoo could get Covid-19 tests but I couldn\'t and polling friends about whether my mask was supposed to match everything.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did anyone find love in the middle of a global epidemic?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These people must have been born with immunity to fatigue and a genetic tendency towards texting.Hopefully these romances, whose foundations were built upon shared Covid-19 hygiene measures, are able to last even when the world isn\'t coming to an end.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constantly posting solo selfies on social media with single cups of tea, purring cats and actual paper books, these introverts areRedefining hygge and hoping the Zoom calls, or at least the social distance, continue even after the pandemic is over.Keeping the number of Covid-19 deaths to 26 to date, holding a peaceful pandemic election without anyone deciding it would be a good idea to storm the seat of government and communicate with their citizens even without Dr. Anthony Fauci.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nice job, New Zealand!&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;People are not convinced that Pfizer vaccine is safe for kids&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;A professor from Texas had a message for parents who might be reluctant to get their children vaccine against Covid-19: Go for it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was fine, apart from that.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My message to parents who might be concerned is very simple: We need to immunize as many people as possible to end this Pandemic, and that means immunizing children as well," said Torres, who teaches at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.Torres is not the only parent who is happy with Pfizer\'s announcement.Some of the loudest applause came from parents with high-risk children who have already been vaccinations.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said she made a point of reading the opposing views before she decided to get the vaccine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She only had the first vax so far and expressed no particular discomfort or signs of illness."Wallis said that since the start of the Pandemic, she has insisted on remote school for her two children.After her second shot, we\'ll put her in full time.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new report gave me hope that my almost 9-year-old will be able to get his vax soon, as well.I was very concerned that my son would not be able to get vaccine because I am one of the people who truly fears and respects the dangers of Covid.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everyone else in the family would have been eligible within the coming months except for him, and that had me worried."Paradis said her 18-year-old daughter, Madeleine, works at a nursing home and was vaccinations in January.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Despite their use of extensive PPE, we were worried about her risk of exposure every day."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that children as young as first graders might be able to get vaccine by the start of the next school year."I feel like I would like to see some more studies on that," said a Louisiana mother of two sons."I personally haven\'t gotten the vaccine yet, so for me I\'d rather wait."Seleigh Taylor, a school administrator with daughters ages 4 and 9, said during the same discussion.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., Russia and Australia, mothers were the most reluctant to do so.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the results of a recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey are any indication, they are most likely to be Republicans or from rural areas.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunanda Gaur, director of the Clinical Research Center at the Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Jersey, said that after word got out that the center would begin testing Pfizer\'s and Johnson & Johnson\'s vaccines in children, it began getting calls from parents who wanted to.Parents are interested in putting their teenagers in studies.We were surprised.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;The French president ordered a Covid lock down across all of France&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;With the death toll nearing 100,000, intensive care units in the hardest, PresidentEmmanuelMacron ordered France into its third national lock down and said schools would close for three weeks as he sought to push back a third wave of Covid-19 infections that threatens to overwhelm hospitals.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that, nursery and primary pupils will return to school, while middle and high school pupils will continue their distance learning.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are more Covid-19 patients in intensive care than at any point in the last year.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only 12 percent of the population have been inoculated so far.&lt;p&gt;

Tony Evers, a Democrat, renewed several mask mandates recently, only to be rejected at every interval by Republicans in the Legislature."As we work to fully and safely reopen our state, we trust our residents to follow CDC guidelines when appropriate, get vaccine when ready, and always use common sense."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evers said he will continue to fight to keep residents out of Covid\'s way.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state leads the nation in giving the vaccine to residents.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;Sleeping too little in middle age may increase the risk of dementia&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"Researchers have pondered the link between sleep and cognitive decline for years.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to know if insufficient sleep is a symptom of the brain changes that underlie dementia, or if it can actually help cause those changes.It followed almost 8,000 people in Britain for 25 years.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It found that people who slept six hours or less on an average weeknight were 30 percent more likely to be diagnosed with dementia than people who slept seven hours or more.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question of which comes first, the sleep problem or the pathology, was posed by Dr. Musiek, a neurologist and co-director of the Center on Biological Rhythms and Sleep at Washington University in St. Louis.There is a chance that they are capturing people in middle age before they have Alzheimer's disease pathology or plaques and tangles in their brain.The team was able to adjust for several behaviors and characteristics that might influence people's sleep patterns or dementia risk, said an author of the study.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression and mental health disorders are linked with sleep problems.The correlation between short-sleepers and increased risk of dementia was found in the analysis of participants without mental illnesses.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if it is modestly associated with dementia risk, short sleep can be important at a societal level.As with other research in this area, the study had limitations that prevent it from proving that inadequate sleep can cause dementia.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the sleep data was self-reported, a subjective measure that isn't always accurate, experts said.The quantitative measure came late in the study, when participants were about 69, making it less useful than if it had been obtained at younger ages.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some cases might have been missed because of the use of electronic medical records.Robert Howard, a professor of old age psychiatry at University College London, submitted comments about the study to Nature Communications.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are compelling scientific theories about why too little sleep might increase the risk of dementia.If you sleep less, the levels of amyloid in the brain will go up.One theory is that the more people are awake, the longer their neurons are active and the more amyloid is produced.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some scientists think it's important to get enough sleep in certain phases.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too little sleep can cause conditions that are known to be dementia risk factors.She said that people with low motivation for physical activity are those who stay up too late and have snacks.There is a shared genetic link between shorter sleep and increased risk of Alzheimer's.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some studies have shown that people who sleep too long are more likely to have dementia.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was an association between long sleep and increased risk, but it was not statistically significant.There appeared to be increased dementia risk in people who shifted from short to normal sleep.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said getting a good night's sleep should make naps unnecessary because it will make up for missed sleep.She said that people with sleep disorders should consult sleep specialists.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, having a regular sleep schedule, avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bed, and removing phones and computers from the bedroom are some of the sleep hygiene guidelines.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We still don't know how the relationship actually occurs in people and what to do about it."&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;The Covid-19 boom is overWhat did we learn from it?&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Scott Cohen was fighting for his life with Covid-19 when his brothers asked Plainview Hospital on Long Island to give him blood from a recovered patient.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After an online petition drew 18,000 signatures, the hospital gave Mr. Cohen, a retired Nassau County medic, an injection of pale yellow stuff that some called "liquid gold."At a time when there weren\'t many other good-news stories, the Trump administration latched on to the idea of plasma as a good-news story.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It gave more than 800 million dollars to entities involved in its collection and administration.Volunteers dressed in superhero capes showed up to blood banks in droves.Cohen was one of them.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By February, with cases and hospitalizations dropping, demand dipped below what blood banks had.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Blood Center called Mr. Cohen to cancel his 12th appointment.A year ago, when Americans were dying of Covid at an alarming rate, the federal government made a big bet on plasma.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one knew if the treatment would work, but it seemed plausible and safe, and there wasn\'t much else to try.More than 722,000 units of blood were distributed to hospitals thanks to the federal program, which ends this month.It gave the country a real-time education on the pitfalls of testing a medical treatment in the middle of an emergency.Medical science takes a long time.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The N.I.H halted the trial because of a lack of benefit.Mount Sinai tried the experimental treatment because blood transfusions carry a relatively low risk of harm, according to an infectious-disease doctor who helped set up the program.With a new virus spreading quickly, and no approved treatments, Diana Berrent, a photographer, was recovering from Covid-19 at her home in Port Washington, N.Y. She formed a Facebook group of Covid-19 survivors that grew to more than 160,000 members and eventually became a health advocacy organization.She livestreamed her own donation sessions to the Facebook group, which in turn prompted more donations.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The F.D.A. used $66 million in federal funding to create an expanded access program for hospitals.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news releases announcing the deals with the American Red Cross and America\'s Blood Centers did not get the attention of the billion-dollar contracts for Covid-19 vaccines that arrived later in the summer.The investment turned out to be significant because the government did not reveal how much it was investing.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to contract records, the U.S. government has paid $647 million to the American Red Cross and America\'s Blood Centers.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When these contracts began, treatments weren\'t available for hospitalized Covid-19 patients.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, the administration announced an $8 million advertising campaign to encourage Americans to donate their blood.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A coalition to organize the collection of blood was beginning to take shape, connecting researchers, federal officials, activists like Ms. Berrent and Mr. Lebovits.The group included a little-known nonprofit organization that had received a $37 million government grant to promote blood donation around the country.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The for-profit companies needed to develop their own blood-based treatment for Covid-19 while the blood banks were collecting blood.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Lee, the corporate vice president of research and incubations at Microsoft, said at a virtual scientific forum in March that they don\'t all get along.The company provided access to its advertising agency, which created the look and feel for the Fight Is In Us campaign, which included video testimonials from celebrities.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to national usage data provided by the Blood Centers of America, there was a spike in hospitalizations and deaths in the fall and winter as a result of Covid-19 cases.In January of this year, when the United States averaged more than 130,000 hospitalizations a day, hospitals were administering 25,000 units of plasma per week.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between November and January, the practice of giving patients two units of blood became standard practice at the Integris Health system in Oklahoma.David Chansolme, the system\'s medical director of infection prevention, acknowledged that studies had shown it was more miss than hit, but he said his hospitals last year lacked the resources of bigger institutions.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Chansolme said that doctors with a flood of patients were desperate to treat them with anything they could that was safe.The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommended against the use of blood in hospitalized patients outside of a clinical trial.The society said on Wednesday that it should not be used in hospitalized patients.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marks said that scientists were too slow to adapt to the recommendations.He said that they knew from previous disease outbreaks that the best time to give the treatment was early.If there is a lesson in this, it is that history can teach you something.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Simon Mucha, a critical care physician, the Cleveland Clinic stopped administering blood products because of a lack of convincing evidence of efficacy.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that science is a process of abandoning your old hypotheses in favor of a better hypothesis, and that she had tracked the scientific literature and that there had been a "sort of piling on" of studies that showed no benefit.There are many promising drugs that fail in clinical trials.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some scientists are calling on the F.D.A. to withdraw the emergency authorization.Luciana Borio, the acting chief scientist at the agency under President Barack Obama, said that ignoring the usual scientific standards in an emergency had drained valuable time and attention from discovering other treatments.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that the agency forgot lessons from past emergencies when it came to plasma.Many of the trials did not succeed because they tested the blood product on sick patients.The results of the trials are consistent if they are treated early.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, the N.I.H. halted a trial of plasma in people who were not yet severely ill with Covid-19 because the agency said it was unlikely to help.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, a page about clinical research about convalescent blood products was dominated by positive studies and news releases, but now it has been changed to promote more than just convalescent blood products.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fight Is In Us is still running Facebook ads, paid for by the federal government, telling Covid-19 survivors that there is a hero inside them and that they should keep up the fight.Even though most blood banks have stopped collecting it, Mr. Lebovits and Ms. Berrent are still encouraging people to donate their blood.Mr. Lebovits helped increase acceptance of monoclonals in the Orthodox Jewish community by setting up an informational hotline, running ads in Orthodox newspapers, and creating rapid testing sites that doubled as

0,2,&lt;p&gt;"A doctor's account of a woman's blood clot case"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;An 18-year-old woman was stricken with headaches, vomiting, seizures, confusion and weakness in one arm early this month, strokelike symptoms that doctors at a Nevada hospital were shocked to see.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One died and their devastating cases led U.S. health officials to recommend on Tuesday that use of the vaccine be paused.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But until the last few weeks, doctors around the world had little information about the condition, and the doctors in Nevada did not recognize it immediately.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rochelle Walensky, the director of the C.D.C., and other top U.S. health officials sought on Friday to assure the public that the pause, now extended more than a week, was a reasonable safeguard to assess risk.They emphasized that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and the other vaccines in use in the United States were safe, given how many millions of Americans had gotten their shots without concern.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health experts fear that the move sends a message that will erode trust globally even if the vaccine is reinstated and that huge numbers of people who could have been immunized will die unnecessarily from Covid-19 because they or their governments rejected the company\'s vaccine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other countries do not.7.4 million Americans have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, and so far, only eight cases of the clotting problem have been linked to it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Europe, Britain, and three other countries, 222 cases have been reported mostly in women under the age of 60.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several countries have limited its use to older adults because so many cases have involved younger people.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The syndrome leaves the patient with low platelet levels and a tendency to bleed at the same time.Why this occurs in some people, many of them younger women, is not known, and experts say that they have so far been unable to identify traits or underlying conditions that may make some people susceptible.In a letter published on Friday in The New England Journal of Medicine, the company said that there was no link between its vaccine and the clotting disorder.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said, "Maybe there are a lot more people out there we\'re not noticing, because of the spectrum of the disease."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real issue is how long it takes to make a decision about what to do, Dr. Fauci said of the C.D.C. The rest of the world is watching, and J.&J. is hopefully going to be an important part of the worldwide response.He said, "You don\'t want to rush them, but I hope they make up their minds in a reasonable amount of time."Her case was described in a letter to the editor.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were blood clot in her abdomen.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had a clot in her brain and was given heparin.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine two weeks before she had a stroke.They stopped the blood thinner and gave her a different treatment for the clotting disorder.The young woman in Nevada was fighting for her life and had to be placed on a ventilator, according to Dr. Lipman.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he was speaking independently and not as a representative of the hospital.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After studying her blood samples, the team realized that she appeared to have the same problem that they had seen in patients in Britain and Europe who had received the AstraZeneca vaccine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They switched from heparin to another blood-thinner and began following guidance provided by doctors in Britain who had treated AstraZeneca recipients with a similar disorder.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person who answered said the line had to be kept open for emergencies and that no one was available to help.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He asked how to reach the company that makes the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was told by the person who answered that the F.D.A. couldn\'t give advice on patient care.The agency wouldn\'t comment on whether it had communicated with Dr. Lipman.After the meeting, Nevada officials issued a statement saying the meeting was the first time they had learned of a case in their state, and they were asking federal partners why the state had not been informed.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said, "Her life, not just her life, her entire family\'s life, has been transformed."&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;Limits on Fetal Tissue for Research have been lifted by the Biden Administration&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"The Biden administration lifted restrictions on the use of fetal tissue for medical research on Friday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to an email statement on Saturday, the N.I.H. will manage and oversee research using human fetal tissue according to policies and procedures that were in place before the ban.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to an email sent to scientists by the N.I., scientists may purchase fetal tissue from sources approved before the ban, and all projects that had been approved before the ban will be reinstated without further review.He warned that it may take some time for research to recover, as many of the scientists with expertise in fetal tissue have left the field.He said that people with decades of experience had to find other jobs.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human cells from a fetus were used to develop the treatments for Mr. Trump.It was hypocritical for scientists to say that Mr. Trump should not have taken a treatment that was developed based on research he had banned.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He hoped a future Republican administration wouldn't reinstate Mr. Trump's ban.He said it would be terrible for the research to be on a yo-yo.If that happens, it will die, according to some conservative and religious organizations.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the 1980s, so-called humanized mice that contain fetal human tissue or organs have served as the linchpin for developing treatments and studying the immune response to pathogens.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fetal tissue is also used to study how human organs and systems develop.How do you study old people to understand the biology of young people?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor said that.In June, the Trump administration abruptly cut all funding to projects in government labs that rely on fetal tissue.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to promote the dignity of human life, the N.I.H. required academic scientists seeking federal funds to provide elaborate justifications of their need for human fetal tissue, and set up an ethics board to review these proposals.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ban halted research that increased the median survival of women with breast cancer from two years to 10 years, according to Dr. Irving Weissman.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration's general embrace of science hints that the Trump-era restrictions will be reversed.They cannot pay donors to obtain the tissue or profit from studies, the agency said, but they are otherwise free to resume research.This is a positive change."&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;Can covid research help solve the mysteries of other Viruses?&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Barie lost her sense of smell and taste while in Europe.She remembers tasting nothing at the restaurant she went to.She said she didn\'t have the heart to tell her host.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Covid has riveted peoples\' attention, many symptoms, like a loss of smell, are not unique to Covid.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart inflammation, lung and nerve damage and small blood clot in the lining of lungs occur in a small but noticeable percentage of patients who have had other respiratory and viral infections.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients can have their own version of "long Covid."No one is saying Covid is the equivalent of the flu that circulates each year.The usual seasonal flu has not killed millions worldwide in a single year, and more than half a million Americans.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is an explosion of interest among funders.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people who say they have lost a sense of smell have actually lost a sense of taste.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some institutions want to know if there is a genetic susceptibility to heart, blood, and lung damage after having a respiratory virus like the flu.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, little is known.Only a minority of patients with respiratory viruses were affected with these conditions, and until the coronaviruses, that was not a big number.Heart problems following a viral infection are among the best studied.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, symptoms like fatigue are not related to myocarditis.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think of Covid-19 and influenza as respiratory diseases, and in fact they are," said Dr. Bruce M. McManus, an emeritus pathology professor at the University.Some Covid patients have lung damage.A lung researcher at the Yale School of Medicine said that it can happen with other viruses.According to Dr. Britto, you can have lung injury and infections with the flu and other Viruses.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With so few patients, Goeijenbier and others used to reproduce and study the effect in laboratory studies and ferrets, the preferred animals to study flu.He said that big journals or funders didn\'t think it was interesting enough.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you learn everything about the coronaviruses, how general is it?&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;There was a decline in suicides in the US in 2020&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"Mental health experts worry that grief, financial strain and social isolation may take a toll on American psyches.Lawmakers were concerned about a rise in suicides because of the coronaviruses.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 2020, Donald J. Trump predicted a surge in suicides.More than 350,000 Americans died from Covid-19 last year, and the number of suicides dropped by 5 percent.The number fell for the second year in a row, even as the number of overdose deaths increased.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal health officials have yet to release a detailed breakdown of the race and ethnicity of last year's suicide victims, and some experts have cautioned against making generalizations based on trends in a few localities.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that it may be that only certain areas or certain cities have experienced these increases among people of color.During times of war or natural disasters, people feel drawn together to fight for survival against a common enemy.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early days of the Pandemic, families posted colorful drawings of rainbows in their windows and children stuck their heads out at night to cheer for health care workers.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial sense of crisis and purpose may have been a source of strength for people around the world.A new study of suicide trends among residents of 10 countries and 11 states with higher incomes found that the number remained largely unchanged or had even declined during the early months of the pandemic, though there were increases in suicide later in the year in some areas.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States has taken a disproportionate toll on communities of color: Hispanic, Black.Two in five Black and Hispanic Americans have lost a close friend or family member to the disease, compared with one in four white adults.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many who remain employed hold jobs that put them at risk of contracting the virus on a daily basis.Anxiety and depression have risen across the board, and many Americans are consumed with worry about their health and that of their families.According to a recent study, one in 12 adults has thoughts of suicide, and Hispanic Americans are more likely to be depressed and stressed about having enough food to eat.You have lost your job.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;George Floyd is next.Researchers who study the racial trends said increases in suicide among people of color were consistent across the cities and regions that they examined, and all the more striking because suicide rates among Black and Hispanic Americans had always been comparatively low.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Moore believes that his son was upset when his school did not reopen.Moore urged parents to be on the lookout for any changes in their children's behavior or moods that could indicate a lack of faith in the future.The number of suicides among Black people remained stable during the first eight months of 2020 despite the fact that overall suicide numbers remained stable.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, which was published in the journal Psychiatry Research in December, found that the average age of suicide death had not changed.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People in minority groups already face unique economic challenges, so the financial crisis from losing a job during the pandemic might be felt even more intensely by these communities.Ms. Pierre said that they told black people not to do that or to go and pray.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do that.We don't talk about it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is taboo to have thoughts of suicide.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a list of additional resources at SpeakingOfSuicide.com."&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;The CDC panel keeps a hold on the J&J vaccine because of the need to assess potential risks&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention decided on Wednesday that they needed more time to assess a possible link between the Covid-19 vaccine and a rare but serious blood-clotting disorder.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may further erode public confidence in vaccination and slow the roll out of desperately needed shots to rural and underserved areas and homebound people.The vaccine is ideal for hard-to-reach people and places because it requires only one shot and is more easily stored and shipped than the vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, which must be kept at very low temperatures.She said that losing the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was a big blow to efforts to stop the epidemic.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australia wouldn't purchase any doses.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Union indicated that it would consider new deals only with companies that were not using the technology employed by Johnson & Johnson.This is the daily edition of The Daily.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision-making process that led the U.S. government to suspend the use of Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine, how long it may last and the impact it could have, is what datememe is today.Carl and I talked about science.On Thursday, April 15th, Carl will walk us through how the decision was made to pause vaccinations with Johnson & Johnson's vaccine in the U.S. There is going to be widespread use of astraZeneca in Europe.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European regulators notice a few rare cases of blood clot after a while.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They begin to investigate if that has anything to do with the vaccine.It's a surprisingly common thing to have blood clot.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of people get blood clot.It doesn't really tell you anything about whether the vaccine is dangerous because people who get it get a blood clot.You need to take a closer look.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were taking place in the brain, and they were associated with low levels of something called platelets.When we get small wounds in our blood vessels, platelets jump into the wound and create a patch.That allows us to heal.That is good.What is bad is when the platelets start to form a big clot, which can then break loose and go around in our bloodstream and end up in dangerous places, like in our brains.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, there wasn't a lot of data that pointed to something similar happening with Johnson & Johnson, but over the weekend, that changed.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The C.D.C. and the F.D.A. have gotten six reports that are very similar to what European regulators were seeing with AstraZeneca, people who have suffered from this distinctive brain clot combined with low platelets.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only six people out of seven million have gotten the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a pretty unusual combination.One of the six people died of a blood clot, and all of them were women.And so that started to set off alarms in the government that maybe we need to stop and take a close look at what is happening.It came down to two.On the other hand, they could be warned.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be very disruptive to stop the Johnson & Johnson vaccine temporarily.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One important factor is that they were wondering how many more cases there were.They knew of six, but maybe there were more that people hadn't reported yet.If they say, hey folks, we're taking this seriously, that might prompt doctors and patients to get in touch and say, hey, I've seen the same thing, or I've experienced the same thing.There is an indication that some of the standard way to treat a blood clot, with a drug called heparin, might actually be bad for this particular condition.You want to make sure that people are aware of the risk of just treating a blood clot like any other blood clot.Regulators are concerned about the danger of blood clot and also the risk of mistreating them.They have to figure out what is going on.They have to figure out if this is a cause and effect that they are looking at.The government officials are no longer just sending out a warning to go for a pause.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are homebound.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are going to send out public health workers to get the vaccine, you don't want them lugging around big freezers.It is relatively easy to send them out with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and then give them the vaccine at home.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do it once, you're done.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It had the advantage of being one shot.A lot of people liked the idea of getting just one dose, as opposed to two with Moderna and Pfizer.There were going to be a lot of people who were going to benefit from having this option.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about hesitancy?We have talked to you many times about how historically safe and effective all three of these vaccines are, and what this pause might mean for the U.S. public.We have to see how well the U.S. government handles the messaging of what they are doing in the days to come.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kind of information that public health officials are going to have to get out, and get out clearly, in the days to follow is essentially a messaging battle for the government, how easily can it communicate safety and the rarity of these blood.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that the theme that the government is hammering on over and over again is that this is how government regulators keep us safe, that they are keeping a very careful watch over us.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The domestic impacts of this decision on Johnson & Johnson's vaccine, but every vaccine maker is attempting to put doses into arms across the world, that's the message.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government is also involved.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want as many people to bevaccinated as possible.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ramifications of these findings are pretty big right now.Johnson & Johnson was trying to get authorization for their vaccine in Europe.They are putting that on hold.There were so many concerns in Australia that they decided not to buy Johnson & Johnson vaccines.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not clear what COVAX will do about this.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Africa was going to use AstraZeneca to treat their health care workers.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They said that they would use Johnson & Johnson because it turned out that AstraZeneca might not be effective against their particular variant of COVID.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are probably not going to use Johnson & Johnson in the near future.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you have any idea of how long this pause will last, given how high the stakes are, here and globally, for resuming J&J vaccinations?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The F.D.A. and the C.D.C. are taking new reports that may or may not represent more of these cases, and then they will look at the data and figure out what happened.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do we need to adjust how we give the vaccines out?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They could restrict who gets the vaccine to minimize risk.Six cases have been in women between the ages of 18 and 48.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does that mean that this vaccine has a significant risk for women?We don't know.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There could be a lot of cases involving men in the next few days.We will see.You could imagine making decisions based on age or sex in the next few days.There are restrictions and different guidelines about who can get the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in the U.S., so this could result in an un pausing of the vaccine pretty quickly.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carl, if you have just gotten the J&J vaccine, this pause period is one where you are craving information.If you just got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, take a deep breath and remember that this condition seems to be incredibly rare.The vaccine may or may not have something to do with it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Severe headaches are one of the symptoms given by the F.D.A. and C.D.C. If in the three weeks after you get your Johnson & Johnson vaccine, you experience a severe headaches, you should call your doctor.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inform your doctor that you got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine if you are not feeling well.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You and your doctor can take things from there.It is a very good thing that you are not going to have these problems, that you are not going to be calling your doctor about it, and that you are going to come out of it unscathed.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fourth United States president to preside over American troop presence in Afghanistan is here.Two Republicans and two Democrats.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a speech on Wednesday, President Biden explained his decision to withdraw all American troops from Afghanistan by September 11th, saying that the United States had achieved its goal of ensuring that Afghanistan would never again serve as a launching pad for a terrorist attack.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump had set a May 1st deadline for the withdrawal of American troops.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Taliban should know that if they attack us as we leave Afghanistan, we will defend ourselves and our partners with all the tools at our disposal.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The white police officer who shot and killed a black man in Minnesota will be charged with manslaughter.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to police officials, Kim Potter accidentally shot Wright when she mistook her gun for her taser.The producers of today's episode were Rachel Quester, Jessica Cheung, and Leslye Davis.Chris Wood engineered it and M.J. Davis Lin edited it.I am Michael Barbaro.The advisory group was called to an emergency meeting on Wednesday to review the reason for the pause: six cases of rare and severe blood clot in the brain in women ages 18 to 48, one of whom died.The Johnson & Johnson vaccine was given to all of the women before they developed the clot.More than seven million people in the United States have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, representing about 5 percent of the population.
0,2,&lt;p&gt;Data shows that overdose deaths have increased during the CDC Pandemic&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;According to preliminary federal data, more than 87,000 Americans died of drug overdoses in the year that ended in September, making it the most deadly year on record.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest jump in overdose deaths took place in April and May, when fear and stress were rampant, job losses were increasing and the strictest lockdown measures were in effect.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current crisis is affecting Black Americans in a different way than it was in the early years of the epidemic, when deaths were mostly among white Americans in rural and suburban areas.The risk of dying from methamphetamine overdose is 12-fold higher among American Indians and Alaskan Natives than other groups.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surging death rate eclipses modest gains made during President because someone who is addicted to a drug like cocaine or methamphetamine is not tolerant of opioids.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Billions of dollars in grants to states allowed more drug users to get access to the three F.D.A.-approved medications for opiate addiction, which work by suppressing cravings and symptoms of withdrawal.Naloxone, the overdose-reversing drug that has saved thousands of lives, became widely distributed.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than half of the participants said the drugs they used had been cut or mixed more than usual, a red flag.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They include measures the Trump administration embraced, like expanding access to medication treatment for opiate addiction, but differed from the Trump agenda by promising to address "systemic inequalities" in prevention, treatment and recovery.Many addiction experts are calling for the repeal of rules that have already been relaxed so that patients don\'t have to come to clinics or doctors\' offices for addiction medications.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that with health departments spending so much on Covid, some programs have had to cut their budgets.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increased H.I.V. cases have been reported in several areas of the country with heavy injection drug use.New restrictions on syringe exchange programs were passed last week by the West Virginia legislature, which advocates of the programs said would force many to close.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prevention and treatment of substance use disorders, as well as $30 million in funding for local services that benefit people with addiction, are included in the American Rescue Plan Act.According to the Office of Drug Control Policy, federal funds can\'t be spent on needles for people who use drugs, but they can be spent on other things.The administration announced last week that federal funding could now be used to buy rapid Fentanyl test strips, which can be used to check whether drugs have been mixed or cut with Fentanyl.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;Is it a mask on or off?Life is getting back to normal&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"Mark forgot his mask when he pedaled off for an afternoon ride on his bike.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told him on the radio that masks were no longer required unless they were in a crowd.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawyer was naked from nose to chin for the first time in a year.He wondered if there was a store he could go into without wearing a mask.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told his wife that nothing was changing, but it was happening quickly.After the trauma of the last year, the evacuees are emerging into sunlight.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many feel out of sorts when they return to the old ways.Do they shake hands?How about a hug?Changing rules, state and federal, that vary by congressional district or even neighborhood, all while the real threat of infection remains, in some places more than others.The curfew has ended in New York.In California, where masks remain recommended, the authorities are looking to reconcile the clash of cues.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you talking about Vanity?Sara J. Becker, an associate professor at the Brown University School of Public Health, said goodbye to that.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was not quite ready for handshakes or hugs, but she was definitely a hugger before Covid.His mother, who lives in Tehran, was just released from the hospital after a dangerous bout with Covid-19, and Dr. Assari feels chastened anew.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he was scared of Covid-19 and was half-vaccinated.People in his neighborhood wear masks, but also seem to be respectful of individual choice.At the medical school, people wear masks despite the fact that it trains doctors, nurses and others in the field.He doesn't think the medical establishment will end its skepticism soon.Vaccination may be slow among both groups, but white conservatives may be quicker to rip off their masks, if they wore them at all.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;FDA plans to ban menthol cigarettes and cigars&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"The FDA said on Thursday that it would ban all flavors of mass-produced cigars, which are popular among youths, and that it would ban the last flavor still allowed in cigarettes.The F.D.A.'s acting commissioner said in a statement that the actions represent powerful, science-based approaches that will have an extraordinary public health impact.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency believes these actions will launch us on a trajectory toward ending tobacco-related disease and death in the U.S. Black Americans are more likely to die from smoking related diseases in the United States than any other group.Since the 1950s, menthol cigarettes have been aggressively marketed to Black smokers in the United States.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the F.D.A., the national rate of smoking has declined from 42 percent in the 1960s to 14 percent today, but the percentage of Black Americans who have successfully quit is less.According to the F.D.A., one study found that a ban on menthol cigarettes could potentially save 633,000 lives by 2050.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two proposals will be drafted and then reviewed by the White House.The last time the F.D.A. proposed banning menthol cigarettes, it received more than 174,000 public comments.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The African American Tobacco Control Leadership Council, the American Medical Association and the National Medical Association are involved in a lawsuit against the F.D.A. The tobacco industry and its allies were quick to criticize the F.D.A.'s plan.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;R.J. Reynolds, which makes Newport, the top-selling menthol brand in the United States, and Altria, which produces several menthol varieties, made it clear that they would not sit back and wait for a ban that would destroy much of their business in the United States.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hours after word of the F.D.A. proposal was leaked, an organization called Law Enforcement was formed.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reynolds American Inc. Services Company, which gave the group $450,000, more than a third of its reported total contributions and grants for the year, invoked an old and discredited tobacco industry argument.The Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act is not enforced by state and local law enforcement."&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;When do we need to wear a mask?Here is how and why the CDC says less often&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;According to the new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, masks can be shed for some relatively safe outdoor activities, especially if you are fully vaccined.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dining indoors at a restaurant, going to the movies, an indoor concert or theatrical performance, attending full-capacity worship services, traveling on an airline flight or riding mass transit, singing in a chorus indoors, taking part in an indoor exercise class, visiting a shopping mall or museum are examples.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the guidance, people are not likely to know the vaccine status of those around them, and it is not yet clear whether fully vaccined people can still spread the virus while not becoming ill themselves.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidance says that unvaccinated people should maintain a social distance.&lt;p&gt;

Center for Gynepathology Research is located in a building that is used for biological engineering.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One in 10 women and trans men are affected by the disease.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its hallmarks are extreme pain and infertility, but it suffers from a branding problem because it falls into the category of women\'s diseases that don\'t kill you.She wants to change the conversation from one of women\'s pain to one of genes and networks.She told the M.I.T. Tech Review that she didn\'t want to make endometriosis a women\'s issue.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She started her career in bioengineering by seeding scaffolds with living cells.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She helped create the earmouse by injecting a human ear-shaped scaffold with a cow\'s knee and growing it on the back of a lab mouse.She has begun growing uterus organoids in her lab from patients with endometriosis.They are close to human uterus cells, which is ideal for testing potential new treatments for the disease.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is possible to take patients who know how they respond or do not respond to therapies, and compare and start to understand and tease apart why that is.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans grow their endometrium once a month, regardless of whether or not a fertilized egg takes hold.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The uterus offers a window into some of biology\'s greatest secrets: tissue regeneration, scarless wound healing and immune function.The endometrium is not static.Her work is drawing interest from people who have never worked on or never thought about the condition."All you cool kids in the other disciplines, this is a really interesting area to ask questions."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her body began imposing limitations when she hit puberty.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her period left her curled in the fetal position for days.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A gynecologist prescribed birth control pills to her when she was 13.She said that it was not done in the South.She focused on what she could control, math and building things, after her mother gave her gin.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She wore all-black outfits when she began graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley, because she had developed an elaborate period regimen.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her pain kept increasing.She was diagnosed as "rejecting her femininity" by the doctor when he looked at her black leather jacket, pixie cut and Kawasaki motorcycle.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She went to the Boston hospital in November 1988 to have a cyst drained from her left ovary.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She woke up the next day to find a row of staples along her midriff, holding together a six-inch incision, after her gynecologist told her she had a disease called endometriosis, which fused her pelvic organs together with a sticky, speckled tissue that resembled the lining of her uterus.The pain was caused by the rogue tissue that responded to her monthly hormones, swelling, and trying to bleed.The doctor who gave the name to the disease called it "tantalizingly beguiling and elusive" in 1940.Not much had changed in 50 years.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was sexism in the approach to Endometriosis.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think there are still some.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After divorcing her husband, she jumped-starting the field of biological engineering, developing technologies to 3D-print organ scaffolds and growing artificial human ears on the backs of mice.Her medium was the building blocks of life.She said it wasn\'t something she wanted to think about.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was annoyed.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She recalled at the scientific meeting that she was working on all the things that the men were working on.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never worked on a women\'s thing.At the end of the event, the moderator asked her where she saw herself in 10 years.Something was inside her.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She mentioned her niece and chronic disease when she blurted out to the luncheon audience.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was better treatment for me when I was 16.She said that if a major breakthrough in treatment did not come soon, she would be in 10 years."Maybe it will be solved, but I don\'t think so."The audience broke into applause.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She used the $500,000 she received from thegenius grant to open the Center for Gynepathology Research.In October 2020, federal funding for endometriosis research doubled from $13 million to $26 million after a Representative shared her own journey on the House floor.It is bad news that she is the first one to do it.It was better late than never.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a little thing that gets out of balance.When the process goes wrong, the models offer a glimpse into what happens.Researchers can see how the immune cells, inflammation and hormones play a role in the disease with her bits of bio engineered tissue.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She sees the uterus not as an island but as an organ that interacts with everything around it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her team connects her models to other organs and hopes one day to seed them with blood vessels, nerve cells and immune cells.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One enduring mystery about the disease is how it can appear in places as far flung as the lungs, eyes, spine and even the brain.Dr. Hugh Taylor, chair of the department of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at Yale School of Medicine, is investigating whether stem cells, which are plentiful in the uterine lining, could contribute to this process by circulating throughout the body.Dr. Taylor has shown that stem cells can be grown in the lab and used to treat diseases like Parkinson\'s and diabetes.One of the most frustrating aspects of the disease is that it can take up to 10 years for a woman to learn that she has the disease.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that others had never heard of a menstrual cup.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am going to say it was disappointing.They began asking patients directly for samples, and have since enroll 1000 patients in their study.The interest in regenerating and self-healing tissues has always been taken by bioengineers.It took them so long to realize that one of the most regenerating tissues is inside the uterus, according to a biological anthropologist who studies reproduction at the University of Illinois.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leading cause of hysterectomies for American women in their 30s is endometriosis.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had a disease that came back twice after she had a hysterectomy.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She faced a new challenge in 2009, when she was diagnosed with cancer.Compared to other diseases, stage 2 breast cancer was a walk in the park.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said it was like a walk in the park.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was understood by the people.Colleagues wrote her cards and sent her food.She was offered a sabbatical semester by her dean.The way breast cancer research was categorized was ahead of its time.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She began talking to Dr. Lauffenburger, who had been studying breast cancer for over a decade, about how to take a similar approach to classifying endometriosis patients.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first step in creating subtypes of the disease was cited by the work.She held lab meetings from her hospital bed in between her treatments because it was his vision of systems biology.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lab meetings were transformed by Dr. Nicole Doyle.We showed up for her treatments and sat with her.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diagnosis had to adapt to her life, not the other way around.She threw a lab party when she shaved off her hair.After battling the old one for so long, Dr. Lauffenburger found it hard to watch his wife suffer from this new foe.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a good thing, scientifically.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;What do women want?Men should get covid vaccines&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"Holly Elgison is a medical claims auditor and her husband is a disaster.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worst of Covid is behind us according to Mr. Schillaci.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Biden administration seeks to get 80 percent of adult Americans immunized by summer, the continuing reluctance of men to get a shot could impede that goal.The reasons for the U.S. gender gap are many, reflecting the role of women in specific occupations that received early vaccine priority, political and cultural differences and long standing patterns of women embracing preventive care more often.Alison Buttenheim is an associate professor of nursing at the University of Pennsylvania and expert on vaccine hesitancy.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only 19 percent of Black males in Los Angeles County and 17 percent of Latino males have received at least one dose of the vaccine, compared with 35 percent of Asian men and 32 percent of white men, according to the most recent data available from early this month.The early divisions in vaccine rates by gender could largely be explained by demographic factors.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Americans over 70 got the first set of shots, and women make up a larger percentage of that age group.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three-quarters of full-time health care workers and over 75 percent of public schoolteachers in the United States are female.The majority of the earliest jobs in food services, retail businesses, health care and government were lost to women.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mothers among them have done most of the work in the shift to remote schooling and caring for parents and sick relatives.The combination may have increased their vaccine motivation in two ways: They are seeking to protect the rest of their family and they are desperate to get back in the work force.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, just as women drove the job losses last year, they are leading the economic recovery now; roughly half a million women joined the labor force in March, in part because in-person schooling has resumed across much of the country.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women are on average more likely to get annual physicals than men, even when adjusted for pre-existing health conditions and other factors, and are more likely than men to get preventive care.According to federal data, men are less likely to go to the emergency room in a crisis and to get basic dental care.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coronaviruses vaccine is the latest expression of the tried-and-true gender gap we have seen.Women might find it easier to navigate the system online since they tend to get more of their health care information online.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have weathered this for more than a year and have a sense of omnipotence.In the most male service branch of the military, the Marines, about 40 percent of those who were offered the vaccine have turned it down.Now that the vaccine is available to everyone, it will be interesting to watch male-female differences in vaccine take up, because these will reflect social and cultural ideas about gender and health, such as the cultural idea that real men don't need preventive health care.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems that not their wives or female friends.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their recent preprint study, professors at Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minn., watched videos with men and women that had the same information about the vaccine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The male-narrated version of the video increased vaccination intention in viewers, but the female-narrated version had mixed responses.Ms. Elgison hopes that her husband will consider taking the shot.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Ms. Buttenheim, the men will benefit from the higher coverage among women.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elgison still has a trump card that she hopes will work.She wants her son to get it so they can travel together.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I told him that we could protect his dad."&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;Patients with long covid face have health risks&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"The health effects of Covid-19 can stretch for months but appear to increase the risk of death and chronic medical conditions, even in people who were never sick enough to be hospitalized, according to a large new study.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between one and six months after being exposed to the virus, patients were 60 percent more likely to die than people who hadn't been exposed.They were also at greater risk of mental health problems, including anxiety and sleep disorders.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the patients' post-covid medical issues could become chronic conditions that would require treatment for the rest of their lives.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not gone away.We don't understand the underlying cause and it's become chronic in some cases, disabling in other cases The study is believed to be the largest yet to evaluate such a comprehensive array of health conditions.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The non-hospitalized Covid survivors in the study tested positive for the virus from March 1, 2020, through November, so in some ways the study may be applicable to a wide swath of people.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The median age of the Veterans Health System patients was 61, and 88 percent of them were male.They compared their risk of death and other characteristics with data from 5 million patients in the Veterans system who did not have Covid-19 and were not hospitalized.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group had a median age of 67, was 90 percent male and had a somewhat larger proportion of white patients.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jacobs said her clinic was seeing a wide range of symptoms.She said the risk of death among the study's patients was higher than she would have expected.She said she was shocked by the number of deaths after a relatively mild or moderate infections.The researchers could not say if the patients had underlying health conditions or if their new symptoms were caused by the coronaviruses.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something is lost when we have a transfer.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient loses and that may make their other long Covid symptoms worse.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unified nature of the Veterans system may actually make it better because of the weakness and fogginess of the person.More than 13,700 patients who had been hospitalized for their initial coronaviruses infections were analyzed by Al-Aly and his co-authors.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that the sickest patients were at the greatest risk of long-term problems, followed by those who were hospitalized in regular wards and never hospitalized.You can recover in three or four days if you stay at home.The segment is the lion's share of Covid patients.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurological, cognitive, psychological, cardiovascular, metabolic gastrointestinal, anemia and blood problems as well as fatigue and malaise were all symptoms that they were more likely to develop or have persistent.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The understanding of the virus and the status of medical treatment are evolving quickly, and this progress is already benefiting some patients.In addition, some people with long Covid have gotten better over time, either on their own or with the help of treatment.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's not let Covid have the ball."&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;A drug passes a big test&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;In an important step toward medical approval, MDMA, the illegal drug commonly known as Ecstasy or Molly, was shown to bring relief to those suffering from severe post-traumatic stress disorder when coupled with talk therapy.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two months after treatment, 67 percent of participants in the MDMA group no longer qualified for a diagnosis of PTSD, compared with 32 percent in the placebo group."This is about as excited as I can get about a clinical trial," said Dolen, who was not involved in the research.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration needs a second positive Phase 3 trial before MDMA-assisted therapy can be approved for therapeutic use.This research could pave the way for further studies on MDMA\'s potential to help address other difficult-to-treat mental health conditions, including substance abuse, obsessive.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A professor at Duke University who was not involved in the new study warned that new treatments are never as wonderful as first thought.MDMA combined with therapy seems to allow the brain to process painful memories and heal itself, according to Dr. Mitchell.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants had sessions with two therapists. Neither the participants nor the therapists were aware of it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The F.D.A. agreed in advance to the study\'s methodology and results, and Scott Ostrom, who participated in the study, had suffered from post traumatic stress disorder.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that if he got separated from his team and was lost in a town, the bullets would dribble out of his gun.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ostrom dropped out of college because of panic attacks.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He got into a romantic relationship after pushing friends and family away.He tried to kill himself and was charged with assault.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He no longer has nightmares after participating in the trial.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Ostrom encountered a spinning, oily black ball while lying on a couch with eye shades.Like an onion, the ball had many layers.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Ostrom said that he became the person he needed to be when he was in Iraq.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Ostrom asked for permission for Scott to return after engaging with the bully over the next two sessions.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason I like calling this medicine is it stimulated my own, Ostrom said.MDMA, which is short for 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine, was invented in 1912.Alexander Shulgin, a well-known chemist, tried to make MDMA himself in 1976.In 1977 Dr. Shulgin shared MDMA with a therapist who introduced it to other mental health professionals.Hundreds of therapists and others administered half a million doses of MDMA over the course of eight years.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Europe, MDMA was responsible for 8 percent of drug-related emergency visits to 16 major hospitals in 10 countries.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that can be used to lift mood.MDMA increases the levels of dopamine and other chemical messengers in the brain by binding to the same proteins that Prozac does.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An estimated 7 percent of the U.S. population will experience post-traumatic stress disorder at some point in their life, and as many as 13 percent of combat veterans have it.The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs spent $17 billion on disability payments for over one million veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder.All had been diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder for more than a decade.Many INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals The trial included data collected by 80 therapists at 15 sites in the United States, Canada and Israel.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After his first session at a study site in Boulder, Colo., a calm awareness settled over him and he felt himself moving inward.It has made me understand the feeling of joy.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;Experts now believe that it is not possible to reach herd immunity in the US&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The term "herd immunity" came to mean the point when enough Americans would be protected from the virus so we could be rid of it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is widespread consensus among scientists and public health experts that the herd immunity threshold is not going to be reached in the foreseeable future and perhaps not ever.It\'s clear that the virus is changing too quickly, new versions are easy to spread, and the vaccine is taking too long for herd immunity to be reached.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift in outlook presents a new challenge for public health authorities.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drive for herd immunity captured the imagination of large segments of the public.To say the goal won\'t be achieved adds another reason why vaccine skeptics don\'t want to be inoculated.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift in experts\' thinking was acknowledged by Anthony S. Fauci, the Biden administration\'s top adviser on Covid-19.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want you to forget that for a second.Once the novel coronaviruses began to spread across the globe in early 2020, it became increasingly clear that the only way out of the pandemic would be for so many people to gain immunity.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, the target herd immunity threshold was estimated to be between 60 and 70 percent of the population.The United States would be able to reach it once vaccines were available, according to most experts, but as vaccines were developed and distribution increased through the winter and into the spring, estimates of the threshold began to rise.The initial calculations were based on the original version of the virus.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The calculation will have to be revised upward if it is found that immunized people can still transmit the virus.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number is expected to improve but probably not enough.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, the United States is unlikely to get 90 percent vaccine coverage.There is a hazy concept of disease transmission in a country of this size. if the coverage is 95 percent in the United States as a whole, but 70 percent in some small town, the virus doesn\'t care In some parts of the United States, inoculation rates may not reach the threshold needed to prevent the coronaviruses from spreading easily.The herd immunity for a wealthy neighborhood might be X, then you go into a crowded neighborhood one block away and it\'s 10X.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to data compiled by The New York Times, less than 2 percent of people in India and less than 1 percent in South Africa have been fully vaccined.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the vaccination levels of that group continue to rise, the expectation is that over time the coronaviruses may become seasonal, like the flu, and affect mostly the young and healthy.The goal is to transition the new coronaviruses to be like its cousins that cause common colds over the long term.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if immunity fades, mild infections are still mild because of partial protection.If we can protect those people against severe illness and death, then we will have turned Covid from a society disrupter to a regular infectious disease.According to Dr. Pradelski, eradication is impossible at this stage.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have to feed it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a challenge to achieve that goal because of skepticism about the vaccines among many Americans and lack of access in some groups.Mary Politi, an expert in health, said that a better approach would be for a trusted figure to address the root cause of hesitancy.She said that emphasizing the benefits of vaccination to their lives, like seeing a family member or sending their children to school, might be more motivating than the idea of herd immunity.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He asked, what are they capable of?Maybe the general public can stop worrying about it, but we will have to.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;The Psychiatry Confronts its Racist Past&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Black skin was thought to be the result of a mild form of leprosy by Dr. Benjamin Rush, the 18th-century doctor who is often called the "Father" of American Psychiatry.He said the condition was called "negritude" and that it was caused by a mental illness.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ad that featured a Black man with a raised fist appeared in the "Archives of General Psychiatry" in 1974.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Psychiatric Association, which featured Rush\'s image on its logo until 2015, apologized for its racist past in January.The governing board pledged to institute anti-racist practices in order to end the inequalities of the past in care, research, and education.Over the course of the three-day virtual gathering of as many as 10,000 participants, the group will present the results of its yearlong effort to educate its 37,000 mostly white members about the psychologically toxic effects of racism, both in their profession and in the lives of their patients.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cheryl Wills said that the work of the task force could prove life-changing for a new generation of Black psychiatrists.She recalled the isolation she experienced in her own early years in medicine, and the difficulty she has had in finding other Black psychiatrists to whom she can refer patients.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that Psychiatry needs to start at the top in order to change.The apology and task force amount to a long-overdue, but still insufficient, attempt at playing catch-up.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They point out that the American Medical Association issued an apology in 2008 for its more than 100 year history of having "Actively reinforced or passively accepted racial inequalities and the exclusion of African-American physicians."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The A.P.A. has a long way to go to get there.According to Dr. Geller, the A.P.A. was first called the Association of Medical Supts of American Institutions for the Insturment.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group came into being in the wake of the 1840 federal census, which included a new demographic category, "insane and idiotic."The results were interpreted by pro-slavery politicians and sympathetic social scientists to find a considerably higher rate of mental illness among Black people in the Northern states than among By the 1970s, the diagnosis of psychosis was handed out so often that the profession was turning it into a Black man.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black patients are less likely than white patients to receive appropriate medication for their depression, according to a 2008 report published in "Psychiatric Services."To change course, and serve Black patients better, organized psychiatry is going to need to make a higher priority of training doctors to really listen.We have to do the work.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Homosexuality was removed from the second edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders by the A.P.A. in 1973.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has taken a long time for the kind of soul searching that occurred around that decision to happen with race.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discipline of pathologizing Black people, as three reform-minded authors put it in 1970 in the American Journal of Psychiatry, has a history of treating Black people as seething cauldrons of psychopathology.It seemed like I was letting the family down when a family member told me on my match day that she was disappointed that I had matched to psychiatry and not another specialty.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a study by the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission, psychiatrists do not participate in public or private health insurance programs.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all providers, 90 percent reported accepting new patients with private insurance, 85 percent said they accepted those with Medicare, and 71 percent were willing to see Medicaid patients.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reimbursement rates for primary care physicians were higher than for mental health practitioners.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The A.P.A. is pushing for full insurer compliance with the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, a 2008 law that requires health insurance plans that provide mental healthcare.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a system where a lot of people can\'t get access, so many patients are cut off from access to quality care, that\'s the thing that\'s bothered me the most in the practice of Psychiatry.We might say one thing, but our actions suggest another.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;The robot surgeon is going to see you&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Sitting on a stool several feet from a long-armed robot, Dr. Danyal Fer wrapped his fingers around two metal handles near his chest.As he moved the handles up and down, left and right, the robot mimicked each small motion with its own two arms.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the robot\'s tiny claws did the same when he pinched his thumb and forefinger together.This is how surgeons operate on patients.After this brief demonstration, Dr. Fer and his fellow researchers at the University of California, Berkeley showed how they hope to advance the state of the art.A new kind of computer software took over after Dr. Fer let go of the handles.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the same technologies that underpin self-driving cars, drones, and warehouse robots are being used to automate surgical robots.The father of robotic surgery said that it is an exciting time for these methods, which are still a long way from everyday use.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim is not to remove surgeons from the operating room but to ease their load and perhaps even raise success rates.The hope is that automated robots can bring greater accuracy to other tasks, like incisions or suturing, and reduce the risks that come with overworked surgeons.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that his wife still had her hands on the wheel, even though the car was driving on its own.She would take over when it was time to leave the highway.Five years ago, researchers with the Children\'s National Health System in Washington, D.C. designed a robot that could automate the surgery of a pig.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The method is far from practical, as the markers are not easily implanted or removed.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence researchers have improved the power of computer vision, which could allow robots to perform surgical tasks on their own, without markers.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A neural network can learn to recognize a cat by analyzing thousands of cat photos.Neural networks can learn from images captured by surgical robots.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video streams into a viewfinder that surgeons peer into while guiding the operation, watching from the robot\'s point of view.But afterwards, these images also provide a detailed road map showing how surgeries are performed.They can teach new surgeons how to use the robots and train them to do their own work.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Fer and his colleagues took pictures of the robot moving the plastic rings.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their system learns from the images that the best way to grab the rings is by passing them between the claws and moving them to new pegs.The robot missed the spot by millimeters when the system told it where to go.Over months and years of use, the many metal cables inside the robot\'s twin arms have stretched and bent in small ways, so its movements were not as precise as they needed to be.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with automated technology is that it struggles to deal with change.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Berkeley team decided to build a new neural network that analyzed the robot\'s mistakes and learned how much precision it was losing with each passing day.Brijen Thananjeyan, a PhD student on the team, said that it learns how the robot\'s joints evolve over time.The robot could grab and move the plastic rings if the automated system could account for the change.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is like a car where the lane-following is autonomously but you still control it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plastic pegs moving is one thing, but cutting, moving and suturing flesh is another.An associate professor at the University of Texas, Austin asked, "What happens when the camera angle changes?"For the foreseeable future, automation will be something that works alongside surgeons rather than replacing them.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The signal lag is too great to allow doctors to perform surgery across distances greater than the width of the operating room.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Fer said that if a robot could handle some of the tasks on its own, long-distance surgery could become viable.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surgeons will need new tools when people are on the moon.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;"Faith, Freedom, Fear: Rural America's Covid Vaccine Skeptics"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;A friendly greeting to Betty Smith, the pastor\'s wife, lingered in the air as the four church women sat down for their regular Tuesday coffee and conversation at Ingles Market.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith felt a blast of judgement from his never-mask, never-vax companion.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing on the table was the Covid vaccine, which made her husband even more uncomfortable.He said after Wednesday night prayer at Tusculum Baptist Church that he wished people wouldn\'t ask.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don\'t think it\'s their business.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the beautiful Appalachian spring unfurls across northeastern Tennessee, the Covid-19 vaccine is tearing apart friends, families, and colleagues.A physician assistant, who runs an events venue with her husband, and who notes that the choice has become more than health care, said that it is a muddy mess.President Biden and American health officials are interested in the voice of communities like Greeneville and its surroundings, which are overwhelmingly Republican and white, as efforts to vaccine most of the U.S. population enter a critical phase.The places where polls show the most resistance to the vaccine are.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their decisions are entwined in a web of views about bodily autonomy, science and authority, plus a powerful regional, somewhat romanticized self- image.While many older residents have been inoculated, now that eligibility is open to all adults, vaccination sites are almost desolate.Many want straightforward information from people they trust.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welfare checks and cash flow from retirees who are moving onto the cheap, vista-blissful land help people survive.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drug busts for heroin and methamphetamine sustain a humming cottage industry of lawyers and bail bonds services.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jim and Rita will not get the vaccine because they died from it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government wants you to wear a mask indoors.As the couple waited to see their family doctor, Mrs. Fletcher said she didn\'t see any benefits from the new vaccine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Free Will Baptists worry that the vaccine includes aborted fetal parts.They don\'t trust the government and they don\'t trust the proprietor of the Mustard.Cross, who is also a volunteer fire chief for Cocke County, has a blue-eyed focus and a warm mountain drawl, whether he is describing his preferred method to rouse people who have overdosed (ammonia rather than Narcan) or answering.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that they jumped into bed with the vaccine.He won\'t tell people to get it or not, but he wants them to do their due diligence.People call these early April weeks the "redbud winter" because redbud trees swell with pink blossoms during the spring chill.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine was brought in by Trump.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this was about politics, he said, you would jump and take it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Cross said that people think the vaccine is too entwined with politics.Scots-Irish settlers hid in the mountains to avoid taxes for centuries.People will take their chances if they haven\'t caught Covid yet.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either way, a win-win: longer life on Earth or eternal life in Heaven.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We should take care of our bodies physically, emotionally and spiritually, but if it\'s my time to go and it\'s by Covid, well then, it\'s my time to go."He said that was the most important thing.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people have adopted a resigned silence because of the Covid shots.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A barista has given up trying to convince her father.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A retired postal worker lets her doctor assume she has gotten the shots because he is a family friend.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she hasn\'t, and won\'t, because she\'s used to speaking her mind.Should she advocate for the vaccine or not?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was the one who got the vaccine early.In her remote corner of the county, people already look at her warily.There is a line between people refusing to socialize with me or not.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were succumbing to a mysterious virus.Later, when her family went into lock down, neighbors dismissed her fears.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone recently posted a newspaper letter on the door of her church and she cried as familiar names appeared on her prayer chain.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It derided Covid mask mandates, "the Prophet Fauci" and vaccines made in part from aborted children.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people, like Mr. Smith at Tusculum Baptist, won\'t use the pulpit to support vaccinations.At a time when he hopes people will return to the church to worship, he doesn\'t want to risk alienating anyone.Daniel Shrader, who leads a small Baptist congregation, is all in on the vaccine.He wants church to be safe for the older, hard-of-hearing ladies to whom he\'s been preaching during the Pandemic by shouting from their porch steps.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which trusted person will speak for the vaccine?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the first local patients to die from Covid was Eva Fields.She has relatives who had the virus, so she asks patients if they are going to get the vaccine.Half of them reply, "No and I\'m not going to."Miss Fields responds, "That\'s OK, honey, I\'m so sorry if that upsets you!"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She doesn\'t encourage patients to get the vaccine, but she does need to do her own research.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lewis was hospitalized for over a month.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was so gravely ill that he recorded farewell messages for his five children.People dropped off food and gift cards on his porch while he was sick.They mowed his lawn, mulched his flower beds, fixed his truck.When he left the hospital, 34 pounds thinner, weak and wobbly, he and his wife struggled to figure out God\'s purpose.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A patient will say, "So are you going to give me the vaccine now?"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has to reply, "I don\'t have it here."The patient is shutting down.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Fletcher doesn\'t worry about the long-term effects of the vaccine.One more blow in a Job-like year that saw the unexpected death of his younger son, a paraplegic, and the death of a nephew, an emergency room physician, has been the reappearance of his prostrate cancer.He said that when you get older, you think you have no more tears, but then something causes them to come back.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lewis patiently addressed the Fletchers\' questions, delineating between what researchers do and don\'t yet know.Dr. Lewis said that he couldn\'t inject a grain of rice with a needle.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lewis held up his phone.He said that if you are worried about being tracked, all the technology is right here.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lewis said that it was his decision."I just want you to be able to make an informed decision and I want to do the best I can to help you."Mr. Fletcher replied, "Well, we have to spend some time in discussion."&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;President Joe Biden gave a speech to Congress&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Unlike in previous years, a progressive group has decided to deliver a formal response to President Joe Biden\'s first address to a joint session of Congress next week.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s not very common for a member of the president\'s party to deliver a rebuttal.He has done a lot that I like.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He\'s going to say a lot of things that I like.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn\'t mean that what\'s been going on so far will continue if we relent.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s important for us as progressives to push and continue to organize because Covid-19 restrictions will keep the House chamber almost entirely empty.The State of the Union addresses are delivered by the president after their first year in office.For decades, the party out of power has given a "response" to the president\'s speech, which they typically use to highlight a rising star in the party.Mitchell recalled an anecdote about a meeting in which Roosevelt told a group of activists that they had convinced him."The worst thing we could do in a moment like this, where we feel like we have momentum, is to slow down and think we can sit back now," Mitchell said.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;Biden has yet to keep some of his immigration promises&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration\'s recent reversal of its plans to raise the refugee cap sparked outrage not only among immigration advocates but from Democrats who accused the president of breaking his promise."Say it ain\'t so, President Joe," said the senator from Illinois.This is not acceptable.Raising the refugee cap is one of at least five promises on immigration made by candidate and President-elect Biden that have not yet been fulfilled as the end of his first 100 days approaches.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas was asked in March if he agreed.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration said in a court filing that it would be ending the practice of holding migrant parents and children who are seeking asylum.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A senior official with ICE told NBC News that they were not ending family detention.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to the limited capacity of border processing facilities, two ICE detention centers for families in South Texas continue to hold nearly 500 parents and children daily.Unless they are awaiting deportation, families are not supposed to be held for more than 20 days.After that, they are typically released as they await their day in immigration court.A senior ICE official told NBC News that the administration will keep family detention centers as a tool.The Biden administration said it would admit 62,500 refugees in the next fiscal year, which begins in October.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be a thorough investigation of who is responsible and whether or not the responsibility is criminal and if that has been concluded the Attorney General will make that judgement.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, no review has been launched.In a recent court filing, the Justice Department blocked the release of Trump administration documents that detailed the planning of the "zero tolerance" policy that separated nearly 3,000 migrant families.The DOJ didn\'t immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;Biden celebrated the milestone of 200 million doses in his first 100 days&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The tax credit, which will be funded by the Covid, was announced by President Joe Biden as he boasted of reaching his goal of 200 million shots administered in his first 100 days.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States this week reached Biden\'s goal of 200 million shots administered, vaccine supply is starting to outstrip.Biden called on all companies, regardless of size, to offer paid time off, and offer other incentives, such as gift cards or bonuses, to encourage employees to get vaccinations Even without the supply of Johnson & Johnson\'s vaccine, the U.S. has been shipping out more doses than are being used.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you\'ve been waiting for your turn, wait no longer.While some people are resistant to getting the vaccine because of safety concerns, others feel less urgency about getting vaccine because they are younger and need a simpler process with fewer obstacles and some encouragement, an administration official said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paid time off effort is aimed at addressing those concerns.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No working American should lose a single dollar from their paycheck because they chose to fulfill their patriotic duty of getting vaccine," Biden said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don\'t have enough confidence to send abroad now, but I expect we\'ll be able to, Biden said.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;Biden administration chucks illegal alien for non-citizen&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;In a public departure from previous immigration policy, the Biden administration has declared that words such as "alien" and "illegal alien" are out and "noncitizen" and "integration" are in.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to the vision set by the administration, the heads of Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, have been asked to update their terminology.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the memo, the new words are "the preferred terminology" and "inclusive language."The changes, which are considered guidance, will apply to agency outreach, internal documents and communications with stakeholders, partners and the general public.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agencies "set a tone and example for the country and its world partners" according to the memo.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dropping "unaccompanied alien children" is one of the changes ordered.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word "alienage" would be changed to "non-citizenship."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acting director of the agency that handles immigration benefits signed a Memorandum of Understanding.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the word changes don\'t affect legal language or operational documents, one thing that won\'t change for any of the agencies is reference to the files on people who enter the immigration system as "Alien" files.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The public perception would be changed by the language changes.The changes reveal how humanity can be reflected in our immigration policies, said Barragn, a member of the Homeland Security Committee.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House has promoted Biden\'s immigration proposal as an effort to "restore humanity and American values" to the country.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The terms have been seen as dehumanizing and as hate language by advocates, while groups that want to restrict immigration have clung to the words.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2015, Joaqun Castro, a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, introduced legislation to remove the words "alien" and "illegal alien" from federal law.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Castro said in an email that the language that dehumanizes people as somehow less than human is not only wrong, but also dangerous.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty-three people died and many more were injured.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author decried "the Hispanic invasion of Texas" in a statement that police said was posted by the shooter.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I proposed in my CHANGE Act legislation that the Biden administration update its communication practices to ensure our words reflect our values.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AP Stylebook no longer uses the word "illegal immigrant" or "illegal alien" except in quotations.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FollowNBC Latino on social media.&lt;p&gt;

0,2,&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration awarded a large amount of money to make vaccine needlesWhere are the needles?&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;A year after a Connecticut company was awarded almost $1.3 billion in federal loans and contracts to supply an essential syringe for the Covid-19 vaccine, no syringes have been made.The first of a series of approvals it needs from the federal government before it can be manufactured, and a factory promising 650 jobs remains unbuilt.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With half of adults in the U.S. already receiving a vaccine, the need for the device has waned, leaving the contracts and loans in question.Moderna didn\'t respond to a request for comment, and Johnson & Johnson declined to comment.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of the vaccine makers would confirm pending approval requests.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Weston, a spokeswoman for the foundation that runs the industrial park in North Carolina, said that the plant hasn\'t been built.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve Hofman of ApiJect said the land in North Carolina has been graded and cleared for construction.He wouldn\'t say when construction would begin, but he did say that the Defense Production Act would be used to finance U.S. companies that wanted to make medical supplies.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loan to Kodak was announced too early.An inspector general\'s report found no wrongdoing, but Congress is still investigating the loan, according to a recent statement issued by the House Select Committee.The Defense Production Act loan was approved by the Trump administration.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Defense Production Act loan, there was a Department of Health and Human Services contract worth up to $450 million at the end of January and a Defense Department contract worth up to $251 million in May.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The release said it would create a surge capacity to supply more than 500 million in 2021.Rick Bright warned colleagues in an email that it could take two years to make enough vaccine for the U.S. The technology hasn\'t been approved in the U.S. for any use.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The needle\'s use with specific Covid-19 vaccines must be approved by the FDA.The FDA would have to determine if storing vaccine in the syringe didn\'t cause problems, such as corroding the plastic.The vaccine makers need to get the approvals.A senior HHS official in the Trump administration said it was surprising that the FDA hadn\'t.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hofman said the loan is close to being finalized but declined to predict when it would be completed, citing ongoing due diligence by the federal government.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Defense Production Act loan program has a number of applications for critical projects that are in various stages of our stringent diligence process, according to the agency.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that last year there was a concern that we would run short in these things, and that everyone was critical of the lack of planning on other elements of the response to the Pandemic."So the idea that the United States supported an option to create significant new domestically based capacity with a very strong supply chain, we have always thought as a public policy matter that was absolutely the right thing to do."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA approval process for its syringe product was misstated in the earlier version of the article.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the companies could make a submission to the FDA for the device\'s approval, they had to receive two vaccine makers with its devices for testing.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two vaccine makers had submitted their vaccines for approval to the FDA for use with ApiJect\'s syringes, but the company did not tell NBC News about it.&lt;p&gt;

0,2,&lt;p&gt;Biden says the guilty verdict in the Chauvin trial is a step forward&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;President Joe Biden said Tuesday that the guilty verdicts in the trial of a former Minneapolis police officer were a step forward, but that the nation still has to reckon with systemic racism in all walks of life.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video of Floyd pleading for help as Chauvin knelt on him for more than nine minutes was seen around the world last year, sparking a wave of protests over police brutality.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his most direct comments about the case and race in America, Biden noted the police officers who stepped up to testify for the prosecution instead of closing ranks.He gave credit to the activists who protested and the "brave young woman" who recorded Chauvin kneeling on Floyd\'s neck.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden said it felt like it took all of that for the judicial system to deliver basic accountability.Black Americans and Black men have been treated as less than humans.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden was taking a virtual tour of an electric battery company in South Carolina before the verdict was read, because so many Americans have now seen the racial injustice that Black Americans have known for generations.The President\'s Dining Room has staff members in it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden and Harris spoke with Floyd\'s brother, Philonise, from the Oval Office after the announcement.You are an incredible family.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harris said on the call, "In George\'s name and memory, we are going to make sure his legacy is intact and that history will look back at this moment."She insisted that Biden wasn\'t trying to prejudge the case, but he did say that if the jury hadn\'t been sequestered he wouldn\'t have made the comment.If Biden had made the comment before the jury was sequestered, it would have been worse.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats need 60 votes to overcome a filibuster in the Senate, where the legislation passed without Republican support.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House has endorsed the legislation, saying it is important to hold police officers accountable for abuses of power and tackle systemic racism in police departments.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She told him at Floyd\'s funeral that he had changed the world.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let that be his legacy," Biden said, as he urged protesters to remain peaceful.The raw emotions of the moment will be exploited by those who have no interest in social justice.He said that this is a time for the country to come together.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;"The verdict in George Floyd's death was praised by US lawmakers"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers applauded the jury that found Chauvin guilty on all three counts in the murder of George Floyd.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tim Scott, the only Black Republican in the chamber, said the outcome offers renewed confidence in the integrity of the justice system.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no question in my mind that the jury reached the right verdict, and there is more work to be done to repair the tenuous relationship between law enforcement and Black and minority Americans.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So we have to do our job in this chamber." said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat who represents the state where the murder happened.It\'s time for the Senate to pass police reform to hold officers accountable for misconduct, increase transparency in policing practices and improve police conduct and training.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have every expectation that the jury was thoughtful and deliberated for a long time.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The defendants can appeal if they don\'t like the verdict.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he was thankful that "justice has been served."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He vowed to "continue our efforts to bring meaningful change to police departments across the country."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Justice is George Floyd going home to his family tonight."It\'s not working.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that creates a lot of complexity in the moment.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nancy Pelosi said the verdict was a step in the right direction for justice done and called it a clear response to the video of Chauvin.We saw it happen.Pelosi spoke at a news conference with members of the Congressional Black Caucus.She thanked George Floyd for sacrificing his life for justice.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Romney said he was pleased that the temperature would hopefully be brought down.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jury\'s verdict delivered accountability for Chauvin, but not justice for Floyd.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we build a nation that respects the human dignity of every person, real justice for him and too many others can only happen.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;The Republican effort failed to censure Waters&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Democrats on Tuesday shot down a Republican effort to censure Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., over remarks she made in Minnesota that earned her an admonishment from the judge presiding over the trial in the death of George Floyd.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said she was not moved by the GOP criticism of her comments.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Chauvin\'s attorney asked the judge to declare a mistrial over Waters\' comments, arguing that she had in effect prejudiced the jury.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The request was denied, but Judge Peter Cahill called the comments "abhorrent."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I\'ll give you that Congresswoman Waters may have given you something on appeal that may result in this whole trial being overturned," he said as arguments concluded and jury deliberations started.Speaking to reporters, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said GOP criticism of her was "absurd," adding that the chairwoman\'s remarks did not amount to a call for violence.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hakeem Jeffries ridiculed McCarthy for having the "nerve" to take aim at Waters and said he should focus on his own caucus.Kevin, clean up your mess.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview with MSNBC\'s "Morning Joe," Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., said Rep."Well first of all, I have been very clear in speaking out against any kind of political rhetoric that encourages violence," said the second-ranking House Republican who was.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge in the trial acknowledged yesterday that if the ruling goes the wrong way, it could cause grounds for an appeal.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;Jordan and Demings had a heated exchange over law enforcement&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;There was a shouting match at Tuesday\'s House Judiciary Committee hearing on a hate crimes bill.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good police officers deserve your support.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know, it\'s interesting to see my colleagues on the other side of the aisle support the police when it is politically convenient to do so.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That\'s when Jordan cut into her speech, prompting Demings to raise her voice and slam her hand on the table.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What?"Law enforcement officers deserve better than to be used as pawns, and you and your colleagues should be ashamed of yourselves," she said.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;Are blue states racist as well?&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;During a Senate hearing Tuesday about voting rights, Republican senators questioned whether state laws in Democratic-controlled states are racist and whether her own gubernatorial race was stolen.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was testifying to advocate for passage of a sweeping federal overhaul of the U.S. voting system that is being pushed for by Democrats.She has led the national criticism of a recently-enacted Georgia law that placed new limitations on voting in the state.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and New York do not have no excuse for not voting.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abrams wondered if the voting laws in Connecticut, Delaware, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and New York were racist.The Texas senator pressed the states again. She said that Georgia\'s law was at issue because it had targeted communities of color by changing a longstanding mail voting policy only after voters of color embraced it.She said that the intent always mattered and that she had no problem with non-strict voter ID requirements.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jim Crow looked at the intent, not just the activities.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looked at the behaviors and it targeted behaviors that were disproportionately used by people of color.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of those states have begun to roll back those laws, while states like Georgia are trying to pass them.She has said she lost the Georgia governor\'s race due to voter suppression.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you still believe that the election was stolen?She said that she acknowledged at the beginning that Brian Kemp won under the rules.I object to the rules that allowed thousands of Georgia voters to not vote in this election."We don\'t know what they would have done because not every eligible Georgian was allowed to participate fully in the election," she said.&lt;p&gt;

0,2,&lt;p&gt;There are many posts about plans to attack the CapitolThis evidence has not been used in court&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;FBI officials have repeatedly said they gathered no credible intelligence in the weeks leading up to the insurrection, suggesting that pro-Trump extremists intended to storm the U.S. Capitol.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if we created a crush situation?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Push from the back.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They will have to get out of the way.One post on a very active forum for angry Trump fans was titled "If we occupy the Capitol building, there will be no vote."The posts raise new questions about whether the FBI missed or failed to act on these threats, and why federal prosecutors have not determined whether anyone planned.A Justice Department spokesman and the FBI declined to comment.In the past, FBI officials have said that unattributed comments on social media don\'t always add up to credible.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gary Peters, the Michigan Democrat who chairs the Homeland Security Committee, called it a massive and historic intelligence failure.The Department of Justice Inspector General is investigating, according to the FBI\'s top counterterrorism official.The intelligence report from the FBI\'s Norfolk field office described threats to attack the Capitol, and was passed to the Capitol Police on January 5.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If those were occupied or sabotaged, they would have to come out and face us in order to leave," a user named "Free Speech Master" said.The map was reposted over the next several days.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All the other agencies are directly under the control of Trump, so taking the Capitol would lead to a successful coup," reads a post from a user named CommunismSucks.Don\'t tolerate elected officials who hate our country.The chance to restore this country is January 6th.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some posts discussed what type of guns to bring, and how to build gallows and hang members of Congress.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some users on TheDonald.win asked for help in joining extremists, including The Proud Boys, who have been charged with conspiracy in the Capitol riot.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One user, who called themself "2021is1776," posted a picture of his hotel room full of weapons and tactical gear, hoping not to need them.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When all of the s--t starts, I want to be in the group that tracks down this guy," the user wrote above a picture of Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other posters on 4chan\'s /pol/ board, which is affiliated with The Donald but shares far-right users and viewpoints, made more explicit threats before January 6.As many people as possible.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will storm the government buildings, kill cops, kill security guards, kill federal employees and agents, and demand a recount.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FBI says it must wait for a tip before it can look at public social media, despite Justice Department guidelines that say the bureau should be proactive in hunting for threats.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee asked the head of the FBI if some of the best intel was open source.The plans to attack the Capitol were discussed on social media.What is the bureau\'s policy when it comes to reviewing social media when it\'s not appropriate to do it?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We follow up on tips from social media companies.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of the public give us tips about what they see on social media.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did not address the Justice Department guidelines that govern the FBI, which state: "To carry out its central mission of preventing the commission of terrorist acts against the United States and its people, the FBI must draw."&lt;p&gt;

The D.C. National Guard confirmed that acting Army Secretary John Whitley has approved the deployment of 250 troops, but officials said the city\'s initial request was for as many as 1,000.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a chance of First Amendment demonstrations in the District of Columbia after the verdict.The request, however, has been met with frustration from Defense and Guard officials who believe the city is relying too heavily on National Guard troops.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city is bracing for the possibility of unrest if the jury does not reach a guilty verdict in the Chauvin trial.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chauvin is accused of killing George Floyd.The prosecutor argued that he squeezed the life out of Floyd by pinning his knee against his neck.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pentagon wrangled commitments from some states for a total of 2,300 troops after several days of calls and meetings.Defense officials said the long-term commitment has created funding issues and made it harder for Guard units to meet other commitments.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Guard members must take time off from their regular jobs to perform their military missions, and officials said employers are becoming weary of the lengthy time off.The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael McGuire, chairman of the National Guard Association of the United States, said in an interview after the March request that state Guard leaders were tired of the ongoing "pickup game" of using Guard troops to supplement law enforcement in D Thousands of Guard members are being used for COVID-19 vaccinations, and others are deployed overseas or providing assistance after fires, tornadoes and other state crises, there also continues to be unease over the complicated and unusual Guard leadership situation in D.C. The continued indefinite nature of this requirement may impede our ability to man future missions as both adjutants general and guardsmen may be skeptical about committing to similar endeavors.A law enforcement official told The Associated Press that the entire police force was going to be activated on Monday.The official said that the department has canceled vacation days and requests for time off.&lt;p&gt;

0,2,&lt;p&gt;The trial judge says the protest remarks by Waters could fuel an appeal&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The judge in Chauvin\'s murder trial criticized recent comments by Waters, saying her words could be grounds for the defense to appeal a verdict.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several GOP lawmakers called for her expulsion from Congress.Chauvin\'s attorney asked the judge to declare a mistrial over Waters\' comments, arguing that she had prejudiced the jury.The judge said that Waters\' comments were "abhorrent" and that she may have given the defense a chance to win the case.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waters told reporters that they need to get more aggressive if Chauvin\'s trial ends in acquittal."We have to make sure that they know that we mean business," Pelosi said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., accused Waters of inciting violence if the Democrats don\'t censure her.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., called for Waters to be immediately removed from Congress, and other GOP lawmakers called for a "sanction" to hold her accountable.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is who they are and how they act.Conservatives said her comments encouraged more violence and rioting.She said that Republicans were trying to distract from right-wing violence by fighting with one of their targets.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jewett Walker, a politically connected African American pastor in Los Angeles, has worked with Waters for years.In 1992, a year after Waters was elected to Congress, her South Central Los Angeles district exploded after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat King.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you call it a riot, it sounds like it was just a bunch of crazy people who went out and did bad things for no reason," Waters said at the time, according to the Los Angeles.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was understandable, if not acceptable.Republicans have long used Waters as a boogeyman to raise money and to excite their base, and as a wedge to try to persuade moderate swing voters not to support other Democratic candidates in battleground districts.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She will not be deterred, and neither will Americans who are demanding more accountability from our criminal justice system."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is such a lightning rod, that her Republican challenger last year, Joe Collins, raised a whopping $10.6 million, and he went on to outspend Waters more than 5.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though Collins lost the race by a wide margin, he has already raised more than half a million dollars for a second chance.It is the same clause that liberals wanted to use to prevent former President Donald Trump from running for office again.You push them back.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her remarks came after criticism of incidents in which Trump officials were antagonized in restaurants.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That earned her a spot near the top of Trump\'s enemies list.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick died of natural causes&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Washington\'s chief medical examiner has determined that Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick died of natural causes the day after the riot.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said there was no evidence of external or internal injuries, and that all that transpired played a role in his condition.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sicknick was honored in a ceremony at the Capitol and buried at Arlington National Cemetery after two men were accused of attacking him with bear spray.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His family said, "Brian is a hero and that is what we would like people to remember."In a statement, Capitol Police said they accepted the findings.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department mourns the loss of our beloved colleague, Officer Brian Sicknick, who died in the line of duty.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statement said that the attack on our officers, including Brian, was an attack on our democracy.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;Student loans and food stamps could be revoked by a Minn lawmaker&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"The legislation, authored by Republican state Sen. David Osmek, would affect a lot.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It faces a difficult path to become law because the state House and governor's office are controlled by Democrats.The Minnesota state Senate is under GOP control but the state House and governorship are held by Democrats.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legislation was signed into law by the governor of Florida.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill stiffens criminal penalties for crimes committed when protests become violent."&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;Biden will deliver remarks after the verdict&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"The White House is preparing a statement for Biden after the jury in the Chauvin trial renders a verdict, according to multiple administration officials.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jury will begin deliberations.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president is expected to emphasize the pain, grief and outrage sparked by George Floyd's death and that of other Black men at the hands of police.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the country braces for a verdict in the Chauvin trial, the White House is in contact with local officials to prepare for protests.The team will remain in contact with the officials on the ground, as well as with civil rights leaders and community stakeholders."&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;"The Supreme Court won't hear the Republican challenge"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court denied an appeal from Pennsylvania Republicans who said the secretary of state had no authority to extend the deadline for receiving mail-in ballots in the 2020 general election.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pennsylvania officials urged the court not to take up the case because the election was over and the total number of ballots was not at issue.The Republicans challenged the secretary of state\'s decision to allow three extra days for receiving mail ballots, saying only the legislature could authorize such a change.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republicans brought similar challenges to voting changes in other states, all based on the claim that only legislatures can make substantive changes in voting procedures.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 2000 Bush v. Gore case, four justices and some lower court judges said that because the Constitution provides that every state must choose its presidential electors, only the legislature can change voting rules.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court said the Constitution\'s reference to "legislature" in a separate but similar clause meant the entire lawmaking apparatus, not just the two state houses.&lt;p&gt;
0,2,&lt;p&gt;"Biden's energy policies are endorsed by the mine workers union"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"The United Mine Workers of America leadership announced Monday they support President Joe Biden's green energy policies in exchange for a robust transition strategy, a move the union hopes its membership will support as a way to transition toward new jobs.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., is joining the union for its announcement Monday morning.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love my job.I wouldn't trade it for anything.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden faces a tough decision between preserving jobs in industries like coal and shifting to cleaner power sources, and progressives in Congress are putting pressure on him.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coal industry has faced a steep decline for decades, with nearly half of mining jobs since 2012 gone as the tug of war between environmental activists and fossil fuel companies continues to play out.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They don't want to fix the problem with the coal.They want to kill it.West Virginia is one of the states that are going to go under because they want to wipe us out, according to the man who has been working the midnight shift in coal mines for the last decade.In his $2 trillion infrastructure plan, Biden proposed a sweeping investment in green energy such as wind.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I get the clean energy, but I feel like I have been wrongly targeted as the biggest contributors to climate change.We don't want our planet to get ruined.We don't want it to be our fault, but it's definitely not all on us.Gary Campbell, a 16-year miner from West Virginia whose father is also in the industry, said in a phone interview that they have always been under attack.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name of the union that endorsed Biden's green energy plan was misstated.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United Mine Workers of America is not the United Mine Workers Association."&lt;p&gt;

Steve Stivers, R-Ohio, announced that he is stepping down next month to lead his state's Chamber of Commerce.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people of Ohio's 15th Congressional District put their trust in me to represent them in the halls of Congress, and it has been one of the biggest honors of my life.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He won his 2020 race by a wide margin, 63 percent to 37 percent, and his district favored former President Donald Trump 56 percent to 42 percent.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stivers served as the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee from 2016 to 2018, the year Democrats retook the majority in the House."&lt;p&gt;

0,2,&lt;p&gt;There is a chaotic race for a single House seat&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;A cardboard cutout of former President Donald Trump fell down near the end of a Republican candidates forum at a Mexican restaurant in Corsicana, Texas.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rodimer put a cardboard Trump back in position, standing behind the two candidates who were on the stage.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The candidates, 11 Republicans, 10 Democrats and two others, are running in a jungle primary to represent Texas\' 6th Congressional District and replace Ron Wright, a Republican who had won a second term but died this year after contracting Covid-19.As Election Day nears, candidates have been fighting for headlines and for the attention of the nearly 1-to-1 ratio of candidates to potential voters at some forums and events.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The battle for the once-safe GOP district that has trended to the left in recent years could offer some clues about whether embracing Trump helps or hurts Republicans in a contest.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But such a chaotic field, and the nature and timing of special elections more generally, will likely obscure any broad lessons.There is a huge field of candidates, and we could see two members of the same party get through.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rodimer, like many of his opponents, has been on a quest to boost his name recognition after early polling showed that he barely registered in the deep GOP field.It depends on how much they\'re tying that effort to Trump.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the Republican candidates have appealed for an endorsement from Trump, who hasn\'t made a decision.Susan Wright is considered the Republican front-runner and a representative for Trump did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She and another top GOP contender, state Rep. Jake Ellzey, have largely avoided mention of Trump, and Michael Wood, a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, has steered into an explicitly anti-Trump lane.Romney won the district by 17 points, but Trump won it by 3.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright won his last election by 9 points, and the seat has been held by a Republican since 1983.Rodermund told voters at a forum in Waxahachie that if he had been in Congress, he would have shouted a false election.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In interviews, voters said they were most impressed by Wright, Kim and former Trump administration official Brian Harrison.Harrison, who has promoted his record as chief of staff at the Department of Health and Human Services, has distributed mailers showing him standing alongside Trump in the Oval Office.Mailers from candidates like Wright and Ellzey are devoid of Trump\'s image.Kim said that while Trump policy, particularly on the economy and China, "very much resonated" with Republican voters, there was reason not to emulate him too closely.They want you to fight.During a candidates forum weeks ago, Sery made headlines for saying about China and potential Chinese immigrants: "I don\'t want them here at all."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wood is backed by a congressman who is a frequent critic of Donald Trump.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the rest of the party is going to get to where I am eventually, or we can do it after we lose in \'22, \'24, \'26 and cede the country to the Democrats for a generation."Wright, meanwhile, has an Joshua Blank, research director, said that the district remains a likely Republican seat, with the Democratic track record of late, pretty poor in flipping their targets.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Democrats will be happy to have a candidate in the likely run-off."So trying to build a campaign in a time that nobody saw the potential was incredibly frustrating and really hard work."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bean said the experience of competing in a jungle primary against so many "Trump Republicans" was like being on the set of a movie.District 6 has become closer in the last decade.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said it was close to blue.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tarrant County has turned blue.Fort Worth has turned blue.Arlington.&lt;p&gt;

0,4,&lt;p&gt;The Brazilian tribe warns that they are killing the forest&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The livelihoods of some of the world\'s most vulnerable indigenous communities have been devastated by the rise in Brazilian Amazon deforestation.Our chief environment correspondent, Justin Rowlatt, has been trying to find out what this has meant for an Amazon tribe he first met in 2010.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had expected a yawning cultural chasm would make it difficult to connect with the people, but I felt like Mr Bean when I first visited them a decade ago.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the older tribespeople had grown up in the Amazon rainforest without ever having contact with the outside world.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Awa found my incomprehension about the ways of the jungle hilarious.When I tripped over the roots of the jungle path and was offered a charred and rotten monkey to eat, my hosts laughed at me.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the plight of the community, they remain good natured despite my visit being a source of great entertainment.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I visited in 2010 my best friend in the community, Pirai, told me they could hear chainsaws in the rainforest.The last people on Earth who still try to live as traditional hunter-gatherers live in a 289,000-acre forest reserve.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, loggers and farmers have been invading their ancestral lands and clearing the forests, and two years ago the threat to the Awa got even greater.The world would need to give Brazil $1 billion in foreign aid a year in order to stop the illegal destruction of the Amazon.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had been invited to witness the culmination of a Brazilian government effort to stop the destruction of the Amazon.I will never forget watching Pirai and his friend Hamo step nervously into a helicopter for the first time.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effort saw the Brazilian army, air force and military police working alongside the country\'s environmental protection service in a mission co-ordinated by the Funai agency.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their camp was like a military base in Afghanistan.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was crawling with heavily armed soldiers and equipment.The farmers were served with notice to leave and were offered land elsewhere in the state if they did so.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remember one farming family loading everything they owned onto a truck and I watched as it rumbled away to their new life, leaving a The government gave the force a small fleet of helicopters and new vehicles and ordered it to be protected by the police and army.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The equipment of anyone found razing the forest was given permission to be destroyed by the environmental police.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A blacklist of farmers and loggers involved in illegal activities was set up which made it harder for them to sell their produce.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 2012 it had fallen to the lowest level since records began.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That rare thing, an environmental battle that is actually being won", I wrote at the time.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Brazilian government\'s own satellite monitoring agency reported an increase in the number of fires in the Amazon in 2019."If things are quiet, let\'s do this all at once and change all the rules," he said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he meant to say "simplify" the rules.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A senior officer in Brazil\'s environmental police force says that environmental protection has been rolled back in the Amazon.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told me that the job has become a guerrilla warfare.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environmental police officers are being attacked by mobs and loggers trying to keep them out of the forest.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In places where we didn\'t have incidents in the past, now loggers, prospectors, squatters are rioting", the officer said, shaking his head in exasperation.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Brazilian government doesn\'t think it\'s doing anything to undermine environmental protection.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local officials have sometimes withdrawn police protection for environmental officers, but it is not official policy, and the rules on burning equipment have not changed.I wanted to know how the Awa were doing.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seemed like a long time before we got a reply.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a recorded message from Pirai.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could hear birds in the background, but his words were frightening.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told me that the chainsaw is still buzzing.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He sent some photos of the community.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I knew many of the faces.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They didn\'t look like the people I had spent time with a decade earlier.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Loggers, farmers, hunters, invaders...they are all coming back," Pirai said."They are killing our forest."&lt;p&gt;

0,4,&lt;p&gt;A small green rock is warning about climate change&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The rock is greenish in colour and just over 4 cm in length.The piece of sandstone was recovered from the deep ocean far off the coast of modern-day West Antarctica.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists who found it say it shouldn\'t have been there.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was taken off the White Continent by a glacier, carried a certain distance in the ice, and then dumped into the ocean.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rock was pulled up from the floor of the Amundsen Sea by a drilling ship, but they don\'t know where it came from.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wouldn\'t hold up well to a lot of interaction between the ice sheet and the bedrock.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christine Siddoway, professor of geology at Colorado College, said that it would be destroyed and disaggregated.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The age of the deposits was collected by the Joides Resolution ship on its International Ocean Discovery Program "Expedition 379" cruise in 2019.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are in the mid-Pliocene.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About three million years ago.The mid-Pliocene is a period in Earth history that has strong echoes of today.It was the last time the atmosphere had the same concentration of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, which was 400 parts per million.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings confirm that the ice sheet can disappear fairly quickly and that it can be re-located.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are expected to enter the climate of the Pliocene.The little sandstone cobble is a warning, scientists believe, of the conditions we could eventually re-create if we don\'t soon.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally held in Vienna, Austria, #vEGU21 has been online this year because of Covid restrictions.&lt;p&gt;

0,4,&lt;p&gt;When silence descended over Victoria Falls&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;In our monthly feature, Then and Now, we reveal some of the ways that planet Earth has been changing.Victoria Falls is one of the natural wonders of the world, and we look at the effects of global heating on it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spanning 1.7 km at its widest point and with a height of more than 100m, locals refer to Africa\'s greatest waterfall as "the smoke that thunders".The chasm was carved by the action of water along a natural fracture zone in the volcanic rock that makes up the landscape in this region of southern Africa.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As news of the low waters spread, local traders noticed a drop in tourist numbers.As well as hitting the countries\' economies, it also hit electricity supplies, which are dependent on hydroelectric generation.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The region is recording a sequence of extreme droughts that reflect what climate modellers have predicted will occur as a result of an increase in greenhouse gases in the world\'s atmosphere.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This makes the storage of the water in the region more difficult, and makes the impact of the extended dry season more damaging to people and the environment.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The warming trend is expected to continue.The worrying fact facing politicians, policymakers and civil society is that the continent is set to be hardest hit by climate change, yet the capacity to adapt to the realities of a warming world are low.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Africa is on the front line of the battle against dangerous climate change.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Planet Then and Now will continue each month up to the UN climate summit in Glasgow, which is scheduled to start in November 2021.&lt;p&gt;
0,4,&lt;p&gt;Climate justice calls are shaking the world&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The framing of global warming as an ethical issue rather than a purely environmental one is what young activists are breathing new life into.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Solutions must be aligned with the fact that climate justice is social justice," said the 19-year-old climate activist when world leaders took to the (virtual) stage at President Biden\'s climate summit.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are warnings of carbon inequality in wealthy countries.Amy Norman, a researcher at the think-tank, The Social Market Foundation, says politicians need to level with voters on what the transition to net zero will mean for the way we live.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If politicians hit lower incomes where it hurts with their finances, they\'re going to lose support quickly and especially if that\'s seen to be unfair.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where would you charge for a tower block?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the issues politicians must wrestle with as they work out how to deliver on their promises for curb emissions are: Poor people are losing two to three times more than rich people when hit by a flood or storm in Bangladesh, India, and Honduras.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Bjoern Soergel of Germany\'s Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research says the drive towards net zero could mean higher prices for food and energy.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would involve carbon pricing - essentially a carbon tax on polluting fossil fuels - with governments re-distributing some of the profits on a per capita basis.Richer countries would then need to give a fraction of the money to the countries where people live in extreme poverty.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the issue has been contributed to by them.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have the biggest means to tackle the problem both in terms of financial resources and technology.&lt;p&gt;

0,4,&lt;p&gt;The astronauts returned to Earth in a capsule&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;In what was the first night-time landing in 53 years, four astronauts returned to Earth from the International Space Station.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commander of the Crew-1 mission replied, "It is good to be back on planet Earth."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will take those miles.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last crew to land back on Earth at night was Apollo-8, which was the first manned mission to the moon.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The capsule that left the International Space Station moved off into the dark and began its journey back to Earth.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The astronauts traveled into space last November on the first fully operational mission to the International Space Station by a vehicle made by SpaceX.It was not about the view.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 2020, two US astronauts made a test mission to the International Space Station and stayed until July.Since the end of the Space Shuttle programme in 2011, there have been no US launches to the International Space Station.&lt;p&gt;
0,4,&lt;p&gt;There is a restriction on the sale of coal and wet wood in England&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"Curbs on the sale of house coal and wet wood for household burning in England have come into force under new rules aimed at cutting air pollution.Since the clean air acts of the 1950s, there have been restrictions on what people can burn in their homes.The UK's air is cleaner now, but pollution from log burners has gone up.Only 8% of households use them, but they are the biggest source of tiny pollution particles that are most damaging to health, according to government data.It says burning dry wood produces more heat and less soot than wet wood and can reduce emissions by up to 50%.When wood is burned, it creates more smoke and harmful particles of air pollution than dry wood.She said that air pollution can put people with lung conditions at risk of having life threatening asthma attacks.According to Prof Jonathan Grigg, who sits on the UK Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollution, it is only a matter of time before all log burners and other fires are banned in built up areas."&lt;p&gt;
0,4,&lt;p&gt;NASA awarded a $29 billion contract to build a lunar exploration vehicle&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"NASA announced on Friday that it had awarded a contract to SpaceX for $2.9 billion to use Starship to take astronauts from lunar orbit.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a triumph for Mr. Musk in the battle of space billionaires.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the competitors for the NASA lunar contract was Blue Origin, created by Jeffrey P. Bezos of Amazon.SpaceX now outshines Blue Origin and other rocket builders, emphasizing how it has become the highest-profile partner of NASA in its human spaceflight program.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NASA selected proposals from Dynetics, a defense contractor in Alabama, and Mr. Bezos' Blue Origin, which had joined in what it called the National Team with several traditional aerospace companies.Blue Origin, Dynetics and other companies would be able to bid for future moon landing missions, as NASA requires a test flight to fully check out all systems with a landing on the lunar surface prior to our formal demonstration mission.The NASA Artemis program is expected to launch its first uncrewed trip either later this year or early next year.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two options provide competition that helps keep costs down, and provides a backup in case one of the systems encounters a setback.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would raise questions about NASA's need for the Space Launch System rocket, which is expected to cost more than $1 billion.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Artemis plans call for the astronauts to launch on top of a Space Launch System rocket.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike NASA's Apollo moon missions in the 1960s and 1970s, the landers will be sent separately to the moon.The architecture is similar to sailing a yacht across the Atlantic Ocean and then changing to a cruise ship for a short ride into port.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Japanese billionaire, Yusaku Maezawa, has bought an around-the-moon flight on Starship.That trip, which could occur as soon as 2023, would only pass by the moon and not land.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tests so far have all ended tragically, despite the fact that the maneuver of belly-flopping to slow its fall has made great progress.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although he has a track record of overpromising and underdelivering on rocket development schedules, Musk recently pledged that the spacecraft would be ready to fly people to space by 2023.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has twice carried astronauts to the International Space Station for NASA, and it is scheduled to loft a third crew there on Thursday.On Friday, the Biden administration also announced the nomination of Pamela.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Bill Nelson, a former Florida senator, was nominated to be administrator.Never miss an eclipse, a meteor shower, a rocket launch or any other astronomical and space event that's out of this world."&lt;p&gt;
0,4,&lt;p&gt;How many tyrannosaurus rexes have lived on Earth?There is a new clue&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"Some 20,000 adults of the fearsome dinosaur, the tyrannosaurus rex, lived in North America before they were killed off by a meteorite 66 million years ago.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, published on Thursday by the journal Science, opens doors in studying dinosaurs beyond what can be gleaned from individual fossils.The shape of a person's skeleton could be used to estimate how fast a person can run, if someone looked at a human tooth.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith is a biology professor at the University of New Mexico who was not involved with the research.Charles R. Marshall, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley who led the research, said the work started with him wondering, when he held a T. Is this one in a million, one in a billion, and one in a trillion?How could we know that number?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and students in his research group started using tools that biologists use for modern animals and applied them to the dinosaur era.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crux of their calculations hinges on an observation that there are many more small animals than big ones, that rats far outnumber elephants.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They had to plug in the weight of the dinosaur, give or take a few, and also derive other numbers in the law.Dinosaurs are not thought to be cold-blooded like lizards, but they are not as warm-blooded as mammals.Dr. Marshall and his team assumed that there was a difference between meat-eating mammals and Komodo dragons.There was uncertainty about where the dinosaurs lived in North America.Paleontologists don't know whether the range of T. rex was limited to where fossils have been found in the western United States and Canada, or if it stretched to other places with similar climates back then.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The uncertainty is due to the fact that Damuth's law is not absolute.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The population density of spotted hyenas is 50 times higher than that of a mammal of the same size.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Makovicky said when he read the paper that it was eye-opening.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said there are less than 4,000 tigers left in the wild.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study did not try to count younger T. rexes.Research shows that juvenile were almost like a different species.Although they may have been more numerous than adults, few fossils have been found, indicating that most survived this period of life or that the bones of juvenile were less likely to be preserved."&lt;p&gt;
0,4,&lt;p&gt;How large animals could support giraffe-like neck structures&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;You might catch a glimpse of flying giants with wingspans that rival small planes if you were to gaze skyward in the late Cretaceous.The largest animal that ever took to the air was the azhdarchids, which measured 33 feet between wingtips.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms. Williams and her colleagues were stunned by the results of the study.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The animal\'s neck was revealed to be scaffolded by a unique and complex network of helical struts connecting a central neural tube to the vertebra wall like the spokes of a bicycle.A peek into an azhdarchid neck helps fill some of the gaps in our knowledge of their behavior.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kem Kem site is one of the few places in the world where Pterosaurs are relatively intact.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large predatory dinosaurs like Spinosaurus and Carcharodontosaurus, as well as azhdarchids, were attracted to a lush river system that existed about 100 million years ago.Williams and her colleagues identified the specimen as a pterosaur.The azhdarchid probably had a five-foot-long neck and a wingspan that was between 20 to 26 feet.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms. Williams and her colleagues will look at other azhdarchid vertebrae to see if the spoke structure is widespread.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not much of a surprise as we know azhdarchids had incredibly reduced bones and were light for their size.It is hard to work out even a lot of basics because we are working from either flattened or incomplete fossils.&lt;p&gt;
0,4,&lt;p&gt;The ants have a chance to become Queen&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"The Indian jumping ant, Harpegnathos saltator, has many talents.This inch-long arthropod, found in flood plains across India, has a four-inch vertical leap and can take down prey nearly twice its size.Scientists found that Indian jumping ants can shrink their brains by 20 percent and unshrink them in a matter of weeks.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers behind the study say that females of the ant species use this ability to prepare their bodies for reproduction.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The queen is the most powerful person in the colony. queens live more than five times longer than worker ants because they are waited on hand and foot.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a typical colony, the queen is the only female that can have offspring.When a queen Indian jumping ant dies, about 70% of the females in her colony enter a battle Royale-style tournament that lasts up to 40 days.The victors get to spend the rest of their days pumping out babies, as soon as the tournament begins.Although worker ants and gamergates are similar in size, their internal anatomy is vastly different, according to a new study.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe that these ants shrink their brains to conserve energy, a behavior also observed in Etruscan shrews, a tiny mammal that sheds brain size in winter to keep other parts of its body warm.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A professor of biology at Boston University who was not involved with the study said the brain is a costly organ to operate.When female Indian jumping ants transform into gamergates, most of the energy that was once spent on the brain gets diverted to parts of the body that are responsible for reproduction.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers think that the ability to switch between worker and gamergate evolved as a means of ensuring that those that fail in their bids to be queen can.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can be a model for understanding things like epigenetics and the control of plasticity in organisms, even scaling up to humans."&lt;p&gt;
0,4,&lt;p&gt;Could the Pandemic cause an Epidemic of Loss for Women in the Sciences?&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Many women found working from home to be a series of wearying challenges.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technical nature of her work requires long stretches of thought, and she is a biostatistician at the University of Pennsylvania.Finding the time and mental space for that work with two young children at home proved to be an impossibility.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her 5-year-old was at home instead of at school because her day care was closed.With their nanny unable to come to the house, Dr. Stephens tended to her children all day and worked late into the evening.When her daughter was set to start kindergarten, the schools did not reopen, but once the family could safely bring in a nanny, there was still little time for the deep thought Dr. Stephens had relied on each morning for her work.She said she can get things done at 80 percent, but maybe she is at 80 percent as opposed to 100 percent.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a fear that we will have a secondary epidemic of loss, particularly of early career women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniela Witten, a biostatistician at the University of Washington in Seattle, said that it was not unusual for them to hear that women were not as smart as men.She said that some things are changing, but only with great effort and at a slow pace.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During maternity leave, they are expected to keep up with lab work, teaching requirements, publications and mentoring of graduate students.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they return to work, most don\'t have affordable child care.Their institutions sometimes lack the human resources structures common in the business world.A close friend, also a Black scientist, had five family members who contracted Covid-19.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is not helpful.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compounding the frustration are outdated notions about how to help women in science.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jessica Hamerman, an immunologist at the Benaroya Research Institute in Seattle, said that social media has allowed women to share some of their concerns and find allies to organize and call out injustice when they see it.In November, a controversial study on female scientists was published in the influential journal Nature Communications, suggesting that having female mentors would hinder the career of young scientists.The paper just came and said, "We have the solution, let\'s move the graduate students to a senior man."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said department chairs and deans of medical schools would have used the research to steer graduate students toward male mentors and roll back any progress toward making science more equitable.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On her way into the auditorium, Ms. Maddow pointed to a wall with pictures of Lasker Award and Nobel Prize winners associated with the university.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least four women at the university had won prestigious prizes, but their photographs were not on display.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms. Maddow asked.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Vosshall had walked past the wall a thousand times.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She realized that it sent the wrong message to all the high school, undergraduate and graduate students who walked past it.Rockefeller University agreed to replace the display with one that is more representative of the institution\'s history.The pictures were taken down and will be replaced by a more inclusive set.&lt;p&gt;
0,4,&lt;p&gt;There is a new suspect in the fairy circles mystery&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;In the Australian outback, certain grasses grow in eerie rings, with ramparts of dusty green standing at the edge of wide circles of bare red dirt.These rings of spinifex grass look like structures first spotted in the Namibian desert and are often described as "fairy circles."A small study published last month in the Australian Journal of Botany suggests that microbes living in the soil may contribute to the rings\' formation.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have looked at whether the soil is too dry for growth, whether it is too dry for insects, and whether the spinifex is being destroyed by insects.There is no consensus on what is driving the formation of rings.A small European swamp grass grew in a ring pattern because of a build up of soil pathogens in the middle.She and Neil Ross wondered if sterilizing the soil from inside rings would make it easier for plants to grow in it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the seeds were easier to grow in containers of interior soil that had been sterilized.The number of seeds that were sown in the soil from outside the rings that had not been sterilized was the same as the number of seeds that were sown in the inner soil.It seems that sterilizing the inner soil removed whatever was keeping plants from growing.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If new spinifex grasses can\'t handle the pathogens in the soil at the center of their clump, they may sprout instead just outside of it, leading to that signature ring pattern.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Moles thinks that some other soil microbes can help.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Killing potential pathogens from inside the ring makes that soil livable again, she says, but killing everything in the soil outside might have detrimental effects as well.Microbes may have joined the party in the ongoing scientific discussion of the fairy rings.&lt;p&gt;
0,4,&lt;p&gt;Are you confused by scientific jargon?So are scientists?&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Polje, nappe, vuggy, psammite.Some scientists who study caves might not bat an eye, but for the rest of us, these terms might as well be ancient Greek.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of researchers analyzed jargon in a set of over 21,000 scientific manuscripts.Papers with higher proportions of jargon in their titles were less cited by other researchers.Science communication with the public but also among scientists suffers when a research paper is packed with too much specialized terminology.It makes sense that our concepts do as well.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the Web of Science, an online platform that allows subscribers to access databases of scholarly publications, they zeroed in on 21,486 manuscripts focused on cave research.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It attracts a diverse group of researchers, each of whom brings their own terminology.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that anthropologists, geologists, zoologists and ecologists all meet in caves.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A list of cave-related jargon words was compiled by Dr. Martnez.Four of the 1,500 terms were included in the beginning of the article.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mammola used a computer program to calculate the proportion of jargon words in each manuscript.The researchers found that papers with a higher amount of jargon received fewer citations.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of the most highly cited papers used jargon in their title, while almost all had an abstract with less than 1 percent of the words being jargon.It is bad news for science communication if a paper isn\'t getting read and remembered due to fewer citations.David Markowitz is a psychology of language researcher at the University of Oregon.The results of his work were published in 2019.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A space computer was found on the Red World last year.&lt;p&gt;
0,4,&lt;p&gt;As Locusts invaded East Africa, this tech helped squash&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"Jeptoo will always remember the first time she saw a swarm.Ms. Jeptoo works with PlantVillage, a nonprofit group that uses technology to help farmers, and she said the insects hit her hard when they were flying.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 70 years ago, the last plague of this scale was dealt with by Kenya.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nineteen million farmers and herders across these three countries, which bore the brunt of the damage, saw their livelihoods severely affected.As bad as 2020's swarms were, they and their offspring could have caused much worse damage.The success of the insects has been the result of a technology-driven anti-locust operation that was hastily formed after the insects arrived in East Africa.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lesson should be used as a way to adapt to climate change in general.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, the plant eaters spend their time in the deserts of North Africa, Southwest Asia and the Middle East.When rains arrive, they change from a brown to a fiery yellow and form groups of more than 15 million insects per square mile.The plague that hit East Africa in 2020 was two years in the making.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The population of insects was boosted by a wet autumn in the Horn of Africa.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, there would have been between zero and one storm coming off the Indian Ocean.Climate change has increased the number of small, seasonal swarms by eight to 12 per year.People outside of frontline Locust nations who want to start using this system today would encounter a typical technology problem: The version of the tablets that the Locust- In 2020, East Africa lacked experts who could identify Locusts, even if the hardware were available.With swarms suddenly covering an area of Kenya larger than New Jersey, officials were tasked with creating a Locust-combating operation virtually from scratch.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new app, eLocust3m, can be used by anyone with a phone.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The app presents photos of locusts at different stages of their life cycles, which helps users diagnose what they see in the field.TheGPS coordinates are automatically recorded and the photos are double checked.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms. Jeptoo of PlantVillage said that the app is easy to use.She recruited and trained people in four hard-hit areas.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last year, more than 240,000 records have poured in from East Africa, collected by PlantVillage scouts, government-trained personnel and citizens.The first step was only the beginning.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was necessary for countries to act on the data in a systematic way.The entire region had just four planes for spraying pesticides in the first few months.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Craig and his colleagues at Lewa Wildlife Conservancy conduct regular anti-poaching aerial surveys that could be used to seek out and destroy Locust swarms.51 Degrees uses a free program called EarthRanger to communicate with rural communities.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EarthRanger was created by Vulcan, a Seattle-based philanthropic company co-founded by Paul Allen of Microsoft and his sister Jody Allen.The efforts were paying off by June 2020.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The F.A.O.'s Eastern Africa resilience was able to stop the Locusts from entering Africa.The offspring of the 2020 swarms continue to cause damage across East Africa.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the new technology, 28 aircraft and thousands of trained government locust trackers, countries are better able to combat them.In February alone, pilots in Ethiopia and Uganda flew the equivalent of three times the world's circumference.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They sprayed swarms before they had time to grow, preventing the insects from spreading into Uganda and South Sudan as they did last year.The F.A.O. estimates that this effort in East Africa has averted the loss of agricultural products with a commercial value of $1.5 billion.Dr. Hughes is working with experts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to build models that will predict future plagues.It would be possible to implement pre-emptive control strategies that are less harmful than pesticides.&lt;p&gt;
0,4,&lt;p&gt;A 22-million-year journey from the asteroid belt to Africa&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"On the morning of June 2, an asteroid was seen careening towards us.There was nothing anyone could do to stop it.The space rock was five feet long and weighed about the same as an elephant, so it posed no threat.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It gave scientists the chance to study the asteroid before it exploded, and it allowed them to get some of the most pristine, least weathered meteorite samples around.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fragments from the asteroid fell into a national park larger than the Netherlands.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November 2020, the team found 24 meteorites.Scientists were able to uncover the history of this asteroid with breathtaking detail thanks to the telltale geology of these rocky leftovers, observations of their path to Earth and the memories of a dead NASA spacecraft.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 22 million years ago, another asteroid crashed into one of its lonely hills, leaving a small crater and sending shards of Vesta on a space odyssey.One of them was the object that fell over southern Africa in the middle of a lonely journey.Additional telescopes, like the SkyMapper Southern Sky Survey, saw it too, allowing scientists to map out an impact site in southern Africa.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They located security camera footage at a hotel and gas stations that had recorded the fireball, allowing them to more precisely locate the fall site. lions stealthily hunted and slaughtered giraffes while leopards lounged in trees.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case a predator got too close for comfort, the search party was protected by the Department of Wildlife and National Parks.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team were bamboozled many times because the meteorites looked a lot like animal poop.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was named after a watering hole.The meteorites were matched to those found on Vesta with the help of data from NASA.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dawn documented the geology of the dwarf planet from 2011 to 2012 after running out of fuel.The asteroid's Earthbound trajectory was reversed by scientists to corroborate the origin story.The asteroid that crashed into Earth was bathed in this radiation for 22 million years, according to the traces on these meteorites.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The asteroid appeared to have been shielded from space for billions of years because it was not contaminated by the solar wind.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A meteorite expert at the University of Manchester in England said that the study has it all.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one can be sure if Rubria is the correct place to link LA to because of many underlying assumptions.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jenniskens said that meteorite hunts are an exhausting but thrilling way to spend a lifetime."&lt;p&gt;

What should they do?Why are some more successful than others?Do they ever play a role in Washington\'s budget wars?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While scientists in the federal work force typically have their responsibilities defined in considerable detail, each presidential science adviser comes into the job with what amounts to a blank slate.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lack of set responsibilities means the aides as far back as 1951 and President Harry S. Truman have had the latitude to take on a variety of roles.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The science adviser is a resource for the White House and the president to use as they see fit.Even good starts in the world of presidential science advising are no guarantee that the appointment will end on a high note.In 1970, Mr. Nixon ordered Dr. David to cut off federal funding to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.The reason was that it was receiving more than $100 million a year.The president of the United States found the political views of the school\'s president intolerable.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel Sarewitz, a professor of science and society at Arizona State University, argued in a study that the influence of the White House scientist has waned.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that elevating the status of science is smart for Democrats.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientific community likes to see presidential advisers campaigning for science budgets.Not so according to Dr. Sarewitz.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He sees federal budgets for science as having done well over the decades regardless of what presidential science advisers have endorsed or promoted.Dr. Lane said that the moment is good.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that catastrophes like war, the Kennedy assassination and the terrorist attacks of 2001 can become turning points.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that he hopes that Mr. Biden will succeed in elevating issues of energy, climate change and pandemic preparedness.He said that his own tenure saw a funding rise for the physical sciences, including physics, math and engineering.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He got to know the powerful director of the Office of Management and Budget, which set the administration\'s finances, while dining at the White House Mess.A commander in chief\'s objectives may not match those of the scientific establishment, and any influence bestowed by proximity to the president may prove quite narrow.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a science adviser to Ronald Reagan, he supported the president\'s vision of the antimissile plan known as Star Wars.The contentious issue became Dr. Keyworth\'s calling card in Washington, according to Pielke of the University of Colorado.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said it was Star Wars.That was it.Despite intense lobbying, the presidential call for weapons in space drew stiff opposition from specialists and Congress, and the costly effort never got beyond the research stage.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said, "Let\'s end cancer as we know it."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Institutes of Health would be the right place for the initiative, Dr. Lander said at his Senate hearing Thursday.Parthasarathy said that Mr. Biden was unusual in asking for science to have a social conscience and in being a public letter.She said that science has the potential to make a difference on issues of social justice and inequality.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is now a good time to focus on them.&lt;p&gt;
0,4,&lt;p&gt;Michael Collins died at the age of 90&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The first man to walk on the moon, Michael Collins, died on Wednesday at a hospice facility in Naples, Fla.It was an epic moment of exploration, an instant when the fantasy of science fiction writers became a reality.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The soleliest man in history was Lieutenant Colonel Michael Collins of the Air Force, who lost contact with his crewmates and NASA when the lunar module Eagle touched down on the moon in 1969.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wrote in his 1974 memoir, "Carrying the Fire," that he was alone now, truly alone, and absolutely isolated from any known life.I enjoy the feeling.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside my window, I can see stars.Colonel Collins emerged from the moon\'s far side after 48 minutes without a human voice.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wrote, "My windows suddenly flash full of sunlight as Columbia swings around into the dawn."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moon appears quickly, dark, gray and craggy.Colonel Collins contacted NASA and learned that the lunar module had touched down safely.Colonel Collins spotted the lunar module briefly, and he made radio contact with Mr. Armstrong and Colonel Aldrin before their moonwalks.He heard President Nixon call the two men as they stood on the moon to wish them good fortune.From his vantage point high above the Earth, he reminded us of the fragility of our own planet, and called on us to care for it like the treasure it is.Colonel Collins, who had begun flying in 1952, had hurtled through the skies as a test pilot.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He remembered that he was nervous about getting every word right.This was serious.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colonel Collins was worried about the moment when the lunar module would blast off from the moon and land in Columbia.He was aware that if the lander\'s ascent engine malfunctioned, they might be stranded on the lunar surface.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they fail to rise from the surface, or crash back into it, I will not commit suicide, but I will be a marked man for the rest of my life.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Apollo 11 crew splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, they were American heroes, according to Mr. Aldrin, the last surviving member of that crew.He entered the test-pilot program in 1960 after becoming a jet fighter pilot.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was selected by NASA three years later as part of a third group of astronauts chosen to participate in the Apollo mission to the moon.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Agena rocket that they docked with reached an altitude of 475 miles, the farthest penetration of space that anyone had achieved at that time.The first significant test of the docking technique to be employed by Columbia and Eagle was carried out by the 10 astronauts who carried out a second rendezvous when they came within a few inches of another Agena rocket.Since the electrical system was no longer working, they did not attempt to dock with it.He carried out a spacewalk to get a scientific device from the side of the Gemini 8 Agena, after standing up waist-high from an open hatch to take photographs of ultraviolet rays given off by stars.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He retired from the Air Force Reserve in 1982 as a major general.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kate Collins, an actress best known for her long run on the soap opera "All My Children," is one of Collins\'s survivors.His wife was a social worker.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Collins was interested in poetry and literature and had a gift for writing about space.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was the author of Liftoff: The Story of America\'s Adventure in Space and a hypothetical journey to Mars.I have dangled from a cord a hundred miles up, and I have seen the earth eclipse the moon.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have seen the sun\'s true light on other planets.He said that he has a secret and that he will always carry it with him.&lt;p&gt;
0,4,&lt;p&gt;There is a giant gender gap on the moon&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;craters on the moon\'s surface are the remnants of violent impacts over time.A backyard telescope can show hundreds of the largest visible to the naked eye. tina Forget has been drawing lunar craters for years.Ms Forget has an interest in art and science.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to convention, moon craters are named for scientists, engineers and explorers.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of Ms. Forget\'s draws have familiar names.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many do not.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms. Forget wondered who these people were.She said that you have to know how many were women.The International Astronomical Union awards official names to moon craters and other features on worlds around the solar system.Of the 1,578 moon craters that had been named at that time, only 32 were named for women.She said she was not that optimistic.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forget has completed 32 drawings.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pieces are displayed at an art gallery at Bishop\'s University in Sherbrooke, Quebec, and the Rio Tinto Alcan Planetarium in Montreal.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Ms. Forget, the underrepresentation of women in science, technology, engineering and math fields is highlighted in the new film, Women With Impact.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that a crater was an absence of matter.There is a void of women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said she liked the idea of holding a crater in her hand.She started 3-D printing models of the craters in the movie.A stamp that preserves the crater\'s shape is being created by Ms. Forget.She said she could do an outie.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More moon craters are named for women, and Ms. Forget plans to create additional drawings, 3-D models and stamps.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, a crater was named for the computer scientist Annie Easley.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was urged by her husband to consider not only the name of a woman but also the name of a woman of color.Dr. Neish was aware of the small amount of moon craters that honor women.She said that she was gung ho to slowly chip away at that number.She said that women weren\'t allowed to be explorers until the 20th century.There is a historical lag when it comes to lunar craters being named for living people.&lt;p&gt;
0,4,&lt;p&gt;Jeff Bezos has a rocket company&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"Two of the richest men in the world, both with dreams of leading humanity out into the solar system, are fighting over the moon.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dispute highlights that whatever the outsize ambitions of Mr. Musk and Mr. Bezos for the future, the present fortunes of their space companies and the ability to generate the profits needed.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Smith said that it was atypical for NASA to make these kinds of errors.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their flagship missions include returning America to the surface of the moon.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said that the space agency should have stuck with its desire to give awards to two companies.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Blue Origin proposal was a collaboration known as the National Team with three more traditional and experienced companies.The lander they proposed looked like a bigger version of the one used for NASA's Apollo moon landings of the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During previous trips to the moon, NASA was in charge of designs and operations, an approach that triumphantly beat the Soviet Union to the moon.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When interest in the moon waned, the technology had little value to the private sector.This new approach to spaceflight has been successful for sending cargo and now astronauts to the International Space Station.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Falcon 9 rocket is used to launch commercial satellites.The Crew Dragon capsule, which carried a third load of astronauts for NASA to the space station on Friday, will also be used for rides paid for by wealthy space tourists.New Shepard is only meant for short suborbital jaunts.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jim Bridenstine, then the NASA administrator, testified that he would worry if NASA chose only one lander design.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kathy Lueders, NASA's associate administrator for human exploration and operations, said selecting one company to build the first moon lander was the best strategy at the moment.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the document, the agency said it was going to select up to two companies.Blue Origin, Dynetics and other companies will be able to compete in the follow-up competition.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith said Blue Origin would make bids on a future competition.The idea that we will be able to restore competition with something that is completely unfunded doesn't make sense to us.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Smith said that with similar programs in the past, like the space station missions, NASA had hired more than one company even though it lacked certainty on future budgets.Mr. Smith said NASA negotiated the price of its proposal, even though it did not have the same discussions with the other two teams.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dynetics had a rating that was lower.Blue Origin and its partners were judged to be very good, as was Dynetics.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith said the communications system and redundant in guidance and navigation were weaknesses of NASA's proposal.Mr. Smith said that the NASA evaluators dismissed the difficulty in the number of launches and rendezvous required in the proposed solution.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government Accountability Office has 100 days to make a decision on the protest.This is not the first time that Blue Origin and SpaceX have battled over a NASA contract.Blue Origin argued that its proposal, which would allow multiple companies to use the launchpad, should have been chosen by NASA.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The launchpad for the space station is where the Starship trips to the moon would likely begin."&lt;p&gt;
0,4,&lt;p&gt;Where does a candle go when it burns?&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"When a candle burns, where does it go?Is it good to be breathing in melted candle particles?The light and heat from a candle comes from the wax burning.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wax that contributes most of the heat is made of cotton.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The puddles you see around the base are caused by wax that spilled and dripped down without burning.When a candle burns, the hydrogen and carbon from the wax combine with the oxygen in the air to make carbon dioxide and water vapor.Carbon dioxide and water aren't safe, but at low levels they are normal parts of the air.If there's a science mystery keeping you awake at night, send it to Good Question.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that the most powerful indoor sources of particles are candles and cooking.The air pollution is a bigger concern for people who burn candles occasionally.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is worth taking steps to minimize exposure to airborne particles if people burn a lot of candles.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She suggests making sure the room is well-ventilated, and using clean, white candles without too many ingredients, since everything in the candle ends up in the air.As a candle burns, the CO2 and water vapor it produces will cool and mix into the air in the room, becoming indistinguishable from any other molecule.As the air in your room is exchanged with the air outdoors, the molecule from your candle will leave the room and go into the atmosphere.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the next few years, every time someone takes a breath of air, they will be breathing in a few carbon atoms from the wax and a few oxygen atoms from the air in your room."&lt;p&gt;
0,4,&lt;p&gt;The city of St Louis was near 1,000 years ago&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"The city of St. Louis was built on the banks of the Mississippi River a thousand years ago.The city of Cahokia was a hub of immigrants, rich farms and public plazas.At its peak in the 1100s, Cahokia housed 20,000 people, more than any other city in the world.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They said that this practice led to widespread destruction, erosion and unpredictable flooding.They wanted to find out if the hypothesis that Cahokia's environment changed over the course of its development was true.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The landscape of a thousand years ago was reconstructed by using preserved soil layers to dig at the edge of two separate mounds and along the local creek.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the construction of the mounds, the surrounding floodplain was spared from major flooding until the industrial area.Pleasant was not involved in the study.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The land was cleared by the Cahokians.Pleasant said that the amount of land used was stable.While heavy plow techniques quickly exhausted soil and led to the clearing of forests for new farmland, hand tool-wielding Cahokians managed their rich landscape carefully.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most academics assume that Indigenous peoples did everything wrong, said Pleasant, who is of Tuscarora ancestry.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said there was no indication that Cahokian farmers caused any environmental trauma.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flooding caused by the clearing of bluffs for coal mining buried some of the settlement's sites.There is very little evidence to support the western view of what native people are doing.The city may have been abandoned due to environmental factors, like the Little Ice Age.The politics and culture of the inhabitants should not be overlooked.It was pleasant.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn't mean that this is how everyone was or is."&lt;p&gt;
0,4,&lt;p&gt;Dinner is being served on the Space StationIs it beef Bourguignon or lobster?&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"During his six-month stay in the International Space Station, Thomas Pesquet will enjoy lobster, beef bourg and other French food.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Space cuisine has come a long way since Yuri Gagarin was the first to reach space, squeezed puréed beef and chocolate sauce from toothpaste-like tubes.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The food for John Glenn was not very good.The world's space agencies are showing that while life in space is busy, astronauts should at least be able to enjoy a quality meal now and then.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All my colleagues are expecting good food, that's why I collaborated with the French space agency to create menu items for astronauts aboard the space station.They cooked meals for Mr. Pesquet on his first trip to the space station.Mr Pesquet and Mr. Marx met at a conference.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pesquet won't be eating lobster and beef bourguignon every day.The meticulously prepared dishes are intended for celebrations of special occasions like birthdays, with enough for Mr. Pesquet to share.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said there was no grocery store.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can not DoorDash.It needs to remind people of their experiences of eating food on Earth, he said.Food in space can't be exactly like food on Earth.It is freeze-dried to reduce its size and volume.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entree of slow-cooked beef and vegetables contained wine from the mushroom sauce.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The alcohol was not removed from the flavor.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For an hour, that usually means heating the food to 140 degrees Celsius.He asked if he could imagine a cake or a piece of chicken on Earth.The structure was destroyed by cooking at 140.We have to change the cooking techniques, but instead of frustration, Dr. Haumont described the process as exciting, playing with spices and ingredients not traditionally found in French food, like seaweed.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are more than 40 recipes for astronauts that Mr. Ducasse's team has come up with, including flourless, vegan and vegetarian options.The best efforts of the chefs and scientists did not work, despite having to cook it longer and hotter than would be acceptable at a Ducasse restaurant on Earth.A scientist from the French space agency said that they were trying to do a croissant at the beginning.The result was terrible, he said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After adding 75 liters of hot water and waiting five to 10 minutes, the kale retains some crunch and texture.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The astronauts at the space station do eat ice cream occasionally.There are freezers on both the space station and the space station itself, and if there is extra space on the space station, we will try to fill it with a frozen dessert for the crew members.No astronauts have ever eaten freeze-dried ice cream in space, at least not in the 60 years of the space age.The company that makes it, Outdoor Products of Boulder, Colo., now sells a couple million of them a year.Cargo missions to the space station also take up fresh produce like apples, oranges and tomatoes.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The astronauts have grown lettuce and radishes on the space station and eaten them.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cookies were sent back to Earth for safety testing, but the astronauts did not eat them.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the flames spread out of control, stir-frying and other common cooking techniques would be messy and potentially catastrophic.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The physics is different, with heat transmitted through radiation and direct physical contact instead of the flow of hot air like in ovens on Earth."&lt;p&gt;
0,4,&lt;p&gt;The Lighthouse of the Mediterranean has life and death on it&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;You can\'t see diamantine in the dark if you stand at the summit at night.You are floating in an endless pool.The sound of the blackened earth beneath your feet reminds you that you are on this planet.It\'s hard to find a better place to experience the power of a volcano than Strom.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stromboli is also home to a few hundred full-time residents.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their relationship with the volcano is friendly.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The summit has regular explosives that are confined to it, and a slope called the "Sciara del Fuoco" that releases superheated debris into the sea.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The volcano is capable of acts of utter devastation and the window-rattling booms have become barely noticeable background noise. Stromboli is a place with moments of terror.A photographer and videographer who first visited the island when she was 17 said that there is always a calm with a tension underneath.Scientists approach Stromboli.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These blasts are considered to be a major threat.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The volcano has been relatively calm during the past half-century, but the last few years have seen a return to violent form.A hiker was killed by a paroxysm in July.One month later, another shook the island, but no one died.The summit was closed to visitors due to the authorities\' fear of more paroxysms.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is strange.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said it was like a person.You miss it when you leave.Travelers will always want to visit the island because of the volcano spectacle.In some ways, we love danger.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are not living at the base of the volcano.They are living at the top of the volcano.The overarching goal of the science of volcanology is to detect warning signs of an eruption, allowing anyone in danger to protect themselves.Some dangerous phenomena give no fanfare, despite the fact that volcanos usually twitch and convulse before an eruption.A pressure cooker-like bomb of underground water exploded without warning on New Zealand\'s Whakaari/White Island volcano, killing 22 visitors.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may be enough to save the lives of many people.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not a panacea.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ripepe said there was no way to survive at the summit.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either the explosion will crush your internal organs or the hot ash and gas will kill you.He and his colleagues are trying to find other ways to get people to safety.ciphering the complex series of grumbles and twitches exhibited by volcanoes in the run up to an eruption is not easy.La Soufrire, a volcano on the Caribbean island of St.Vincent, is an example of a volcano that can provide salvation if efforts to identify precursors to volcanic violence are successful.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists interpreted suspicious activity in March and April as a sign that something was going to explode.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tens of thousands of people living in the shadow of the volcano were ordered to leave on April 8.The first blast hit La Soufrire the next day.No lives were lost due to the volcano\'s rage, thanks to the early warning and subsequent exodus.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The volcano wrote the chapters of the island\'s history and it will be the author of the island\'s future, too.&lt;p&gt;
0,4,&lt;p&gt;This small county is trying to solve 3 cold cases&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"In October of 2016 the remains of three murder victims, dead for three decades, were laid to rest in a rural corner of Indiana.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two were young men, likely teenagers, the victims of a serial killer in 1983.A woman was found dead on the bank of a creek in 1988.She had been shot in the head, covered with car tires and lit on fire, and her bones had been passed down from one coroner to the next.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He ordered a number of tests to find their true identities.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. McCord gaveNewton County a chance to mourn their kids, as he called them.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He paid for three small coffins.Nineteen high school students volunteered to be pallbearers.After a ceremony at a county building, the teens piled into a yellow school bus and Mr. McCord, a part-time bus driver, followed three hearses, each donated from a different funeral home, to the cemetery.The effort turned into a yearlong crash course in the use of genetic markers to build family trees.It would require a million-dollar machine, a custom-built computer, and the patience of volunteer genealogy buffs.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Margaret Press, a software developer and mystery writer, had used a saliva sample from a customer to log in to a website showing how closely their genetic markers matched with those of other people.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She realized that her skills could be useful to law enforcement when she read a novel about an unsolved murder.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said it hit her.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She co-founded a nonprofit, called the DNA Doe Project, to try to match unidentified remains with genetic profiles that had been uploaded to an open-source genealogy database called GEDMatch.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A set of unknown remains could be related to a distant cousin.To build a large family tree, an investigator could first identify the ancestors the two cousins have in common, such as great- or great-great-grandparents, and then investigate individual branches from those ancestors.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unknown victim would have lived in the right place and time.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research, and the process of elimination, could eventually reveal the identity of the woman.Joseph James DeAngelo, the so-called Golden State Killer who had murdered 13 people and raped dozens in the 1970s and 80s, was arrested two weeks later.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technique used again was the same, except this time the genetic sample came from the unknown culprit, not from a victim's remains.The industry sprang up to help investigators try the technique on their own cold cases.The Golden State Killer and many other cases relied upon a DNA test called a microarray, which generated a subset of key markers from a sample.Increasingly, investigators are turning to private companies for whole-genome sequencing, which reconstructs a person's entire DNA code.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many cold cases have become quicker and cheaper due to the fact that everyone and their grandmother is setting up shop.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six investigators worked full time for four months to find the Golden State Killer.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cases are often solved in weeks or days, thanks to the work of the volunteers and Dr. Press.Dr. Press said that many were from small sheriff's or coroner's offices.She said that they are just as skeptical of the technique as the psychics who frequently call with tips on open cases.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of using ancestry to create a family tree was something Mr. McCord understood.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three open cases were divided by his team.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fisherman found the charred remains of a woman in 1988 and Ms. Goddard was the only one who still had an open homicide.Mr. McCord and his deputy took Adam and Brad.The plan was for all three investigators to take an online course in genetic genealogy, which would walk them through a mock case, after Larry Eyler confessed to the murders of two boys.They realized that they weren't good enough for the work.It involved hour upon hour of computer searches for obituaries, family trees and other public records in order to deduce the precise familial relationships of people with shared genetic markers.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The machine created a file and uploaded it to a server.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lord downloaded the 71 gigabytes of raw data onto a custom-built computer and reassembled it into a complete genetic code.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He focused on a subset of 1.5 million key markers that make up the genetic profiles used by genealogy companies.He sent her profile to the two genealogy databases that make them available to law enforcement for such cases.She wanted to hone her sleuthing skills on the case.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each database produced a list of people who were genetically related to Charlene, sorted by the percentage of their shared DNA.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a match shared 50 percent of her genes, it could be a parent, child or full sibling.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A three-percent match could be a second cousin, a first cousin twice removed, a half first cousin once removed or a befuddling array of other relationships.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were Goddard and Mx.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes several times a week, Chan met via video chat to work through Charlene's matches.Mx.Chan would suggest ways to find Ms. Goddard after assigning her an intriguing match.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mx.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bigger the database, the more likely it will produce a match.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions of people have uploaded their own genetic information to the GEDMatch and FamilyTreeDNA databases.Ancestry.com and 23andMe do not make their databases accessible to law enforcement, even though they have huge databases.GEDMatch was under public pressure to change its access policy.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms. Goddard and Mx were distant cousins.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chan worked for more than seven months.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To protect the privacy of the victim's family, investigators have not disclosed the precise family relationships discovered during the search.She caught a break in January, when GEDMatch changed its terms of service again, allowing its entire database to be used.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news was that Chan had multiple close matches at the top of her list.When Ms. Denton went missing in 1988, she left behind her belongings and a 1-year-old daughter.In February, she talked to her daughter for the first

Denton did not want to be interviewed.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a strong match with him.He is now bullish about the technology's potential to solve thousands of other cases, especially his

memorial services now that they can confirm some of the leads.It was a specific request from his mother, that I be there, because she said I have known Johnny almost as long as she has.&lt;p&gt;
0,4,&lt;p&gt;The first nighttime splashdown with astronauts took place in 1968&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;In darkness, four astronauts splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico near Panama City, Fla. that marked a successful end of a mission for NASA led by a private company.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the first of what the space agency calls an operational mission.Half a year ago, a SpaceX rocket lifted off with the four astronauts, three from NASA and one from Japan, who were sitting inside one of the company\'s Crew Dragon capsule.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just before 3 a.m. on Sunday, the same capsule, named Resilience, safely returned to Earth.Michael Heiman, a SpaceX mission control official, welcomed the astronauts back to planet Earth.The other returning astronauts said resilience is back on planet Earth and they will take those miles.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The compliment was returned by Heiman.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that your crew is a tribute to Resilience.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We wish you all the best at your reunions.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a long trip.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The astronauts boarded the Crew Dragon and the hatch closed at 6:26 p.m., but then more than two hours passed before the capsule left as the astronauts checked that there were no air leaks from either the capsule or the space station.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The space station was moved away from it at 10:17 p.m. after a series of thruster firings.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The capsule then circled the planet until Florida lined up in the correct position for it to splash down in the Gulf of Mexico.The trunk will burn up in the atmosphere after being detached from the capsule.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once it was low enough in Earth\'s atmosphere, parachutes deployed to gently lower the capsule into the sea.On August 2, 2020, when the first crew returning to Earth in a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, the same one that carried astronauts to the space station.During a news conference last year, Douglas Hurley, a member of the earlier crew that completed a water landing in the SpaceX capsule, said he had read reports by astronauts from NASA\'s Skylab missions, some of the last before him to do.He said there was some challenges after the splashdown.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SpaceX has practiced working at night, and in January it successfully recovered a cargo capsule that splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico.That was a problem in August when the earlier capsule splashed down.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than a dozen boats, one of them flying a Trump campaign flag, descended on the singed capsule, and a few went in for a closer look.Private boats might have impeded recovery efforts if there had been an emergency.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk of space junk hitting the water was averted by the Coast Guard setting up an 11 mile safety zone around the splashdown site.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When another group of astronauts, Crew-2 launched last week in a different Crew Dragon, they had a bit, because it is not a big target for a stray piece of debris.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They put their spacesuits back on and got back in their seats just in case the spacecraft was hit, which could cause depressurization of the capsule.Mission control then provided a reassuring update: Further analysis indicated the closest approach of the space debris was not that close after all.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, as a precautionary measure, the astronauts waited until they were told that the space junk had passed by.The next day, a NASA spokesman said the debris had passed by at a distance of 28 miles.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Space Command spokeswoman said a review was underway to determine what caused the spurious warning.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commander for the flight was a colonel in the United States Space Force.The first member of the newly created U.S. Space Force is Colonel Hopkins.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was one of nine astronauts selected by NASA.He had made one previous trip to the International Space Station, spending 166 days in space.He was a member of the crew of the space shuttle Discovery in 2005, on the first shuttle launch after the loss of Columbia and its seven astronauts more than two years earlier.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was a member of the space station crew and spent five months in space.Dr. Walker studied how the solar wind interacted with the atmosphere of Venus while she was a PhD student at Rice University.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The station has 11 astronauts on board, the most since the space shuttles stopped flying.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four astronauts from NASA, two from the Russian space agency ROScosmos, one from the European Space Agency and one from JAXA are leaving behind seven other astronauts.They also performed spacewalks to install equipment on the outside of the space station, including to prepare it for new solar panels, just before they left.Bill Nelson was nominated to be the agency\'s administrator.The Senate confirmed his appointment on Thursday and he will be sworn in on Monday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision prompted Blue Origin and Dynetics to challenge the award.In the past, NASA led the design and operation of the vehicles for its astronauts, including the first Mercury capsule, the Apollo spacecraft that went to the moon and the space shuttles.Since the space shuttles stopped flying in 2011, NASA has had to pay Russia for pricey rides to orbit using the country\'s Soyuz rockets.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Crew Dragon is similar in size to the Apollo capsule that took NASA astronauts to the moon in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Crew Dragon can hold seven people.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be four astronauts at a time for the NASA trips.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crew will return to Earth on April 28 with the Crew-1 capsule, which is more advanced than what NASA astronauts sat in 50 years ago.If you want to fly a Crew Dragon yourself, you can use a web version of the system that the NASA astronauts would use.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people have helpfully explained how to complete the docking.A launch that is to take off as soon as September has been purchased by a billionaire.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three other people will join him on what is to be the first all-civilian trip to space.The other three people are a cancer survivor, a space enthusiast and a community college professor.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NASA wanted to set up commercial crew so that the companies could also sell rides to other customers, according to Kathy Lueders, the associate administrator of NASA.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She wants everyone to be a space person one day.The Crew Dragon capsule is being built for the next group of astronauts headed to the space station, a mission currently scheduled to launch in October.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Axiom trip, which will take four passengers for a stay at the space station, will launch in January.&lt;p&gt;
0,4,&lt;p&gt;NASA has a new mission on Mars&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The small flying robot made history a week and a half ago as the first powered aircraft to take off on another world.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, its fourth flight went farther and faster than ever before, and NASA announced that it was extending Ingenuity\'s life by another 30 Martian days.Ingenuity will explore how it can be used as an aerial scout for its larger robotic companion, the Perseverance rover, after they demonstrated that flying in the thin air of Mars is possible.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 30 Martian days that had been allocated for test flights of Ingenuity were to run out next week, and the plans were to then abandon it, never to fly again.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The videos of Ingenuity flying on Mars that Perseverance has captured and shared with the world are truly spectacular, and the Ingenuity technology demonstration is a huge success.Ingenuity will transition from a technology demonstration where we proved the technical capabilities of the helicopter to an operations demonstration where we will gather information on the operational support capability of the helicopter while Perseverance focuses on its science mission.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ingenuity is graduating from the tech demo phase to the new ops demo phase, where we can show how a rotorcraft can be used and show products.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is possible to look at context features from places that are not accessible by rovers. scouting for potential science observation is one of the operational products we will look at.For the helicopter to transfer to a new airfield, there needs to be scouting for a future rover.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can look at elevation maps in stereo.Lessons learned from that exercise will benefit future missions with aerial platforms.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a 30-day demonstration phase.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ingenuity was built and tested for the original 30 days of technology demonstration flights.The extension of Ingenuity\'s flights reflects not only the success of the helicopter but also the desire of Perseverance\'s scientists for the rover to explore.The crater is called Jezero and was once a lake.The scientists had expected to go to an ancient, dried-up river delta that is a promising place to look for signs of past Martian life.The scientists want Perseverance to collect at least one sample, which will become part of a collection, because the rocks appear to be the oldest in the crater.When the lake first filled with water, the age of the rocks would determine how young Mars was.It was expected that Perseverance would explore this patch of Jezero for several hundred Martian days, perhaps an Earth year or more.The deputy project manager for the rover said during the news conference that Perseverance will no longer take pictures and videos in the air.It will make a one-way trip to the new spot on its fifth flight.There will be at least one or two more flights in May.She said the helicopter could help plan where Perseverance will drive, take pictures of areas too rugged for the rover to drive to and produce stereo images to map the elevations of the Martian landscape.&lt;p&gt;
0,4,&lt;p&gt;Guess which creature made mysterious footprints on the ocean floor&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;sponges are not known for their mobility They don\'t have muscles, nervous systems or organs.New research suggests ancient life-forms can and do get around more than marine biologists thought.Sponges are one of the most primitive forms of animal life, according to Dr. Teresa Morgan.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We thought that was not possible.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, Dr. Morganti and her colleagues examined underwater footage of Langseth Ridge, a marine mountain range not far from the North Pole that sits almost a mile beneath the permanently ice-covered water\'s surface.Despite their initial skepticism, they found evidence that the wild sponges were not only moving about their frigid habitat, but also changing direction and even moving uphill.In a few experiments, researchers have shown some sponge species are capable of a slow crawl by contracting and expanding over days and weeks.It is one thing to know a sponge can do this in a lab.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands of sponges are moving all over the world.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are not seeing it.She said that Langseth Ridge\'s spicule paths could be stop-start, stop-start over decades or hundreds of years.She asked, "How can these massive sponges survive in such an extreme environment?"&lt;p&gt;

0,4,&lt;p&gt;There is insight into the evolution of sleep&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;A study by researchers in Brazil published on Thursday shows that this animal, already considered perhaps, is an extraordinary creature because of its eight limbs, three hearts, blue blood, ink squirting, camouflage capacity and the tragic fact that it dies after mating.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers observed a species in a laboratory.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The color changes are associated with two different sleep states: quiet sleep and active sleep.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During active sleep, it changes its skin color and texture and moves both eyes while contracting its suckers and body with muscular twitches.Quiet sleep usually lasted seven minutes.The sleep states experienced by people, as well as other mammals and birds, are similar to the alternating "rapid eye movement," or REM, and "non-rapid eye movement," or non-REM, sleep states.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medeiros said that if there is any dreaming going on, it should be like small video clips.&lt;p&gt;
0,4,&lt;p&gt;Scientists say the US should research solar geoengineering to fight climate change&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The National Academies of Science on Thursday called for the United States to pursue research into solargeoengineering to cool the Earth\'s atmosphere but urged caution given that it could have risky, unintended consequences.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thinning high-altitude clouds to allow more heat to escape is one of the strategies recommended in the report.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the committee members involved in the report is Peter Frumhoff, the director of science and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists.It is important to understand the full suite of responses to climate change, given how close we are to catastrophic risks.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congress gave the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration $4 million in December to studygeoengineering techniques.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year the U.S.-based nonprofit SilverLining provided $3 million in grants to various organizations to look into solargeoengineering.Harvard scientists plan to fly a balloon over Sweden in June.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the researchers will not release particles to block the sun\'s energy, the experiment will explore the feasibility of doing so.The director of Northeastern University\'s School of Public Policy and Urban Affairs said that this would concentrate power among a few.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is something that a few elites are going to control, and it\'s going to have impacts on everybody else."&lt;p&gt;
0,4,&lt;p&gt;There will be a historic Mars helicopter test flight in April&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;If successful, the experiment will mark the first powered, controlled flight by an aircraft on another body.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The helicopter will be unloaded by remote control and set on the surface before the rover drives away.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPL plans to film the entire exercise with cameras mounted on Perseverance, parked a short distance away, and will beam images.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The helicopter will undertake additional flights up to 16 feet (5 meters) high, assuming the initial sojourn unfolds as expected.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The design was successfully tested in the vacuum chambers at JPL, but it remains to be seen whether it works for Ingenuity.&lt;p&gt;

0,4,&lt;p&gt;There is a peek at ancient wealth inequality in the Maya ruins&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"An examination of numerous houses excavated at two sites in southern Belize is providing insight into gaping wealth inequality in ancient Maya cities - a disparity that researchers believe was closely linked to despotic leadership.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gary Feinman, the Field Museum's MacArthur curator of anthropology, said that there is less concern with the well-being of those people or the efficiency of their production.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Mexico's Oaxaca Valley, where more collective forms of governance existed, there was less disparity in homes.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The houses of Uxbenk and Ix Kuku'il were 30 feet tall. The foundations of the small houses were usually 13 by 20 feet (4 by 6 meters) and the large ones were usually 40 by 66 feet (12 by 20 meters).&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The larger ones had more elaborate architecture and imported and luxury goods including jade, marine shell, personal adornments and the volcanic glass called obsidian"&lt;p&gt;

0,4,&lt;p&gt;One vaccine dose may be enough for those who have previously been exposed to COVID-19&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronaviruses and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19 can be found here.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s possible that the findings will help explain why many COVID-19 patients have blood sugar problems.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The creation and release of hormones that regulate blood sugar levels is one of the jobs of the pancreas.According to a paper published on Wednesday in Nature Metabolism, lab and autopsy studies show that the new coronaviruses can affect the function of pancreas cells by changing their shape, disrupting their genes, and impairing their function.According to the new data, the human pancreas is a target of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and may contribute to the metabolic dysregulation observed in patients with COVID-19.In one study of 59 healthcare workers who recovered from COVID-19 and received one of the vaccines, the levels of antibody after the first shot were higher than the levels seen in people without a history of COVID-19.In a separate study, researchers found that 41 COVID-19 survivors developed high titers within days of vaccination, and those levels were 10 to 20 times higher than unvaccinated volunteers after just one vaccine dose.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients taking colchicine had fewer cases of pneumonia.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Colchicine is inexpensive, taken by mouth, was generally safe in this study, and does not generally need lab monitoring during use, it shows potential as the first oral drug to treat COVID-19 in the outpatient setting," the researchers said.When the booster was given within 6 weeks after the first dose, the vaccine efficacy was 54.9%, but for volunteers aged 18 to 55, it was 82.4%.There was no data for the efficacy of a 12-week gap between the doses given to older volunteers.There isn\'t enough data to determine how well the vaccine will work in people over 55.The authors say that a second dose after a three-month period is an effective strategy.&lt;p&gt;

0,4,&lt;p&gt;There are some COVID-19 issues seen in children&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronaviruses and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19 can be found here.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 100 children and teens were tracked by doctors at a large Italian hospital.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only 42% of them recovered at an average of about five months after their diagnosis.More than one in five kids still have at least one symptom, according to a report posted on Tuesday on medRxiv.Insomnia, respiratory symptoms including pain and chest tightness, nasal congestion, fatigue, muscle pain, and joint pain were the most common persistent problems.Although these issues were more common in children who had been sick, they also developed in youths with few or no symptoms.The researchers acknowledge that there is increasing evidence that restrictive measures are impacting children\'s mental health.The long-term effects of COVID-19 on children should be considered when developing measures to reduce the impact of the Pandemic on their health.Researchers say targeting other sites may be a better approach.More than half of the COVID-19 survivors\' immune systems were able to target other parts of the virus, according to their study.&lt;p&gt;
0,4,&lt;p&gt;"Musk's company violated its launch license in a test"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The first high-altitude test flight of its Starship rocket, which exploded last month while attempting to land after an otherwise successful test launch, violated the terms of its Federal Aviation Administration test license, according to sources.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test flight had been intended to reach an altitude of 41,000 feet, but the company left unclear whether the rocket had flown that high.&lt;p&gt;
0,4,&lt;p&gt;J&J vaccine is effective in preventing severe disease&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The following are some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronaviruses and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A potent new variant has become prevalent in South Africa, which has a protection level of just 57% after 28 days.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two-dose vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna were effective in the trials.The highly transmissible new variant emerged before those were conducted.Walid Gellad, a health policy associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh who was not involved in the trial, said that any protection and additional vaccine is great.The key is efficacy against severe disease, hospitalization, and death.In a news release, J&J said its vaccine was 85% effective in stopping severe disease and preventing hospitalization.The vaccine causes an immune response by introducing coronaviruses into cells.The company plans to apply for emergency use authorization from the FDA next week.Several weeks after the mother\'s infection begins, the levels of maternal blood can be as high as the levels in umbilical cord blood.Out of 83 women who had COVID-19 antibodies when they gave birth, 72 of them also had antibodies but no evidence of direct infections.&lt;p&gt;

0,4,&lt;p&gt;Gutbacteria are tied to disease severity, immune response and high mental health&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronaviruses and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19 can be found here.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that the gut microorganisms in COVID-19 patients were different from those in uninfected individuals.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chinese University of Hong Kong\'s Dr. Siew Ng said that chronic patients lack certain goodbacteria known to regulate our immune system.The presence of an abnormal assortment of gutbacteria, or "dysbiosis," persists after the virus is gone and could play a role in the long- lasting symptoms that plague some patients.Her team has developed an oral formula of livebacteria and a capsule to protect them until they reach the gut.According to the pilot clinical study, more COVID patients who received our microbiome immunity formula achieved complete symptom resolution than patients on standard care.The study was done in June and July of this year.45% of healthcare workers in nine intensive care units met the threshold for probable clinical significance for at least one of four serious mental health disorders.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;34% of the patients studied were black and 26% were Hispanic.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers reported that black patients were four times more likely to develop the disease than white patients.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White patients had a slightly higher risk than Hispanics.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blacks and Hispanics were less likely to use new diabetes technology and had worse blood sugar control than whites.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Osagie Ebekozien of the nonprofit T1D Exchange, the higher risk was likely driven by structural and systemic inequality.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers said that healthcare providers need to screen patients with T1D for socio-economic factors that increase their risk of DKA.&lt;p&gt;
0,4,&lt;p&gt;There are still symptoms 6 months later for COVID-19 patients&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"Some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronaviruses and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19 can be found here.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between January and May, doctors tracked 1,733 patients who were diagnosed and hospitalized.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six months later, 76% had at least one symptom including fatigue or muscle weakness, sleep difficulties and anxiety or depression.Most of those who had been severely ill had ongoing lung problems and chest problems that could indicate organ damage, while 13% of patients whose kidneys functioned normally in the hospital went on to develop kidney problems later, researchers reported on Friday.Bin Cao from the China-Japan Friendship Hospital in Beijing said in a statement that they are only beginning to understand some of the long-term effects of COVID-19.The need for post-discharge care is highlighted by our analysis, as most patients continue to live with at least some of the effects of the virus after leaving hospital.The new coronaviruses use a pathway called ACE2 to get into cells, and this could be a problem with interferon.Researchers looked at cells that line the path from the nose into the lungs and discovered there are two different forms of ACE2 - the well known one and the short form.&lt;p&gt;
0,4,&lt;p&gt;Scientists count carbon in the Amazon&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The small group of men and women sawed and tore trees limb from the dense jungle as they ventured into the Amazon.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They drilled into the soil and sprayed paint on the tree trunks in order to learn how much carbon can be stored in different parts of the tree.The Brazilian team is just one contingent among hundreds of researchers seeking to measure carbon in the Amazon rainforest, which sprawls across more than six million square kilometers in nine countries.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, his team is looking beyond primary forest, examining reforested areas to shed new light on how much carbon they hold - information key to incentivizing restoration efforts.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it as carbon, one of the cheapest and easiest ways to absorb greenhouse gas.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When trees are chopped down or burned - often to make way for farms or cow pastures - the wood releases CO2 back into the atmosphere.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Climate change, natural disasters, and the mass migration of refugees are some of the effects of climate change.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The office of the Brazilian Vice President said that since he took office, at least 825 million tonnes of CO2 have been released.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the southwest of the country, there is virtually no species overlap, so it is completely different plants in the same climate.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If more than 50% of the tree\'s roots are in the plot, the tree should be measured.The Amazon rainforest, which varies from tangled jungle to more open, riverine spaces, is constantly shifting as more trees are chopped down while restoration efforts are accelerated.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Petrobras said in a statement that it had been working for years to honor its "social responsibility" commitments, which included supplying energy while "overcoming" Sanquetta said his project didn\'t get any money from Petrobras, but did get support from the Amazon Fund.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanquetta\'s team members swatted away swarming, stingless bees, while they dissected a 10-by-20-meter plot in the jungle.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of them was wrapped with a tape measure and identified as Bellucia grossularioides, a fruit-bearing tree that is one of the fastest to regrowth.He rattled off the numbers while another scientist wrote them down.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few in the group were hewing into a tree with a chainsaw, having selected it for an autopsy.The shorn trunk was cut into pieces, the leaves stripped and bagging, and the stump dug up and weighed on a scale strung from branches above.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The samples were taken back to the lab, where the team dried and weighed them, before incinerating them in a dry combustion chamber that allows them to measure how much carbon is contained.Rajo said that the work offers a way to measure the health of the planet, but also how quickly the planet could be healed.&lt;p&gt;

0,4,&lt;p&gt;How worrying is the new coronaviruses variant in Britain?&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;A new strain of the coronaviruses is spreading rapidly in Britain and prompting high levels of concern among its European neighbours, some of which have cut transport links.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new variant of COVID-19 has rapidly become the dominant strain in parts of southern England, and has been linked to an increase in hospitalization rates, especially in London and in the adjacent county of Kent.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The governments of Australia, Italy and the Netherlands have detected cases of the new strain.A few cases of COVID-19 with the new variant have been reported to the ECDC, Europe\'s disease monitoring agency.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Openshaw, a professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, said it was right to take it seriously.The main worry is that the variant is more transmissible than the original strain.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has a high number of changes in its genetic code and some of them are affecting its ability to spread.The UK government said on Saturday it could increase the reproduction "R" rate by 0.4, which means it is spreading faster in Britain, making it harder to control and increase the risk it will also spread quickly in other countries.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability of some tests to detect the virus has been affected by this.In recent months, there have been strains of the COVID-19-causing virus that have emerged in South Africa, Spain, and other countries that have raised concern.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK has one of the most comprehensive genetic surveillance programmes in the world, with up to 10% of all virus samples being genetically tested.Steven Van Gucht, head of viral diseases at the Belgian Institute of Health, told a news conference on Monday that few countries do better.&lt;p&gt;
0,4,&lt;p&gt;Black patients have less reliable oximeters than white patients&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"The illness caused by the novel coronaviruses, COVID-19, is three times more deadly than seasonal flu.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flu season in France had been the worst in the past five years in terms of number of deaths, according to a news release.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average stay in the intensive care unit was twice as long for patients with COVID-19 as it was for those without it.COVID-19 patients were more likely to suffer lung failure.People who were hospitalized for COVID-19 had higher risks of death and organ failure compared to people who were hospitalized for the flu.Oxygen levels in the blood can be monitored by using pulse oximeters, which use red and IR light to measure oxygen levels in the blood.When pulse oximeters were first developed, they were mostly tested on whites.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The time it took for patients' medical status to improve was not accelerated by Tocilizumab.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of previous studies were mixed.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A different team of doctors reported earlier this month that the drug reduced patients' risk of dying in the hospital, but the difference was not statistically significant.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Infectious Diseases Society of America does not recommend routine use of tocilizumab in hospitalized patients."&lt;p&gt;

0,4,&lt;p&gt;New vaccines may not be right for some cancer patients&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The following are some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronaviruses and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc has a vaccine partnership with BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc. The fragile molecule is encased in a small packet called a LNP, which protects and delivers it into cells.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer drugs have long been used to carry vaccines into tumors, because they are easy to take up.There is a chance that some of the liposomes carrying the vaccine could be captured by tumor tissues.There is currently no answer to the question of whether the vaccine can become stuck in tumors and affect cancer patients.In a paper published on Wednesday in the British Journal of Cancer, his team calls for a careful evaluation of the efficacy of these promising mRNA COVID-19 vaccines administered as lipid carriers for patients with solid tumors.Researchers collected and analyzed wastewater for several days in March and April at two California sewage treatment plants.They reported on Wednesday in Environmental Science & Technology that the levels of genetic material from the virus were up to 1,000 times higher than in the wastewater, making detection more sensitive and accurate for the solid samples.They found that concentrations of genetic material on different days correlated with the number of new COVID-19 cases reported on those days.&lt;p&gt;

0,5,&lt;p&gt;What happens after legal challenges and broken trust in the European Super League?&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The 12 clubs who want the European Super League are pressing ahead with their plans.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who don\'t are getting ready for the fight.The passion is running high.The vast majority of the opinions are against the project.The ferocity of it has not caught them off guard because they knew what would happen.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are five clubs involved in the semi-finals next week.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers are talking to Uefa about these matches.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to see the clubs being kicked out at this stage but Ceferin did not deny it could happen when pressed on the subject.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A statement released by the world governing body late on Sunday, which said Fifa "disapproved" of the Super League plans, was felt to be a weak response by those who believe they have been betrayed by the bigger clubs.The task of stopping the Super League will become very difficult unless Infantino adopts a stance in line with Ceferin.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They reached this conclusion from different points of view.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clubs say there is no reason why the Champions League can\'t be a part of their own competition.Uefa chiefs don\'t see the situation the same way.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European club competition is the number one competition.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This goes to the heart of the issue.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After almost two years of negotiation, Uefa, with support from the European Club Association, has finally announced a new version of the Champions League.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first phase will be a league format, instead of groups of four teams playing each other twice.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clubs will play 10 matches against each other.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In theory, this increases the number of attractive games.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The teams with the highest Uefa co-efficient who qualified for European competition will get two of the additional four places.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the concept was in place this season, it would be the most likely beneficiaries.The clubs don\'t think the plans go far enough.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They want high-profile games when they play.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statement released on Sunday by the 12 clubs included contact numbers for public relations agencies in Germany and France, which gives credence to the view that, if they get that, it will generate increased revenues which will benefit them and the rest of European football.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chance to replace Agnelli as chairman of the ECA was turned down by the president of Paris Saint-Germain.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three clubs that had previously turned down the chance to be involved were surprised by Sunday\'s developments.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan is for ESL to have 20 teams, but there is no plan for how the additional five teams from the 15 founder members will be selected.According to Super League sources, this could be accomplished through a qualification system in the European competition.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we are talking about the best supported teams, then the teams that would be best placed are: If Uefa\'s club ranking was the determining factor, then Sevilla, Porto, Roma, Ajax and Shakhtar Donetsk would be the entrants.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is all speculation for now.Nobody knows, not even those who want to run the tournament.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could be as early as next season.Evidently that is not the case, so 2022-23 is a more realistic option, although even that will be optimistic unless there is some change of position.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there any trust in the beginning?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When six clubs were accused of backroom dealing, clubs were arguing about Project Big Picture.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one point the second wave of the Pandemic threatened to close the league down again, yet they have continued to meet as a premier league.The break up of the premier league in 1992 was divisive.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clubs want to continue playing in it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be no battle for the top four because virtually all the clubs are fighting to finish.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be almost impossible for those six clubs not to finish in the top six because of the financial gap between the Super League clubs and those excluded.If broadcasters pay more for European rights, it could affect the amount of money they pay the league.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;The Jacksonville Jaguars will have the number one pick in the NFL draft&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The 21-year-old was taken ahead of the New York Jets and the San Francisco 49ers in the first round of the draft.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the first time since 1999 that all three top picks were quarterbacks, and also the first time that the top seven selections were all offensive talent.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With five of the first 65 picks this year, they should have plenty of quality new recruits.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the top two picks had been set in stone, mystery has shrouded who the 49ers would pick after they sprung a huge pre-draft shock by trading up into the third spot.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chicago Bears have made a big mess of the draft in recent years but they hope Fields can finally be their answer at quarterback after they gave up their first round pick next year and two other selections to the New York Giants to grab him.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst insisted "we\'re not going to trade Rodgers" but they chose to bolster their defence by picking Eric Stokes instead of a receiver to help out their quarterback.While the main stage for the selections was positioned with a backdrop of Lake Erie, a red carpet event was held at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After having to announce the picks remotely from his basement a year ago, the NFL commissioner was back on stage in person and was able to give his now customary \'bro hugs\' to the college stars who were in attendance in Cleveland.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was one of the high-profile players at the event. coronaviruses is still having a huge impact on the event and 45 more people have been confirmed to take part over the weekend.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three-day event ends on Saturday with rounds four to seven.&lt;p&gt;

0,5,&lt;p&gt;Is a prolific forward ready to become the next star in the league?&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;When Ivan Toney signed for Peterborough in the summer of 2018, he must have felt that he didn\'t belong.When he was 22, he thought his dream of playing in the English top flight was over.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three years later, he is on the verge of a record-breaking season, having scored 29 goals for Brentford in the Championship, one short of Glenn Murray\'s league high of 30 for Crystal Palace It looks like, one way or another, that dream is back on track for Toby, who joined the club from Northampton Town for a fee of £200,000 in the summer of 2015.After only two league appearances, Toney\'s hopes were never really high and he spent most of his time out on loan.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, he was able to find the right place to make a pitch for Toney to join the club.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A host of other forwards had been developed and sold on by Peterborough, and it was clear they felt Toney fitted the bill.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We continued to watch him at Wigan and Scunthorpe, but when we inquired, they only wanted to loan him.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did a deal with them for £300,000 and he came with his parents and his agent.I told him we would put him in the window.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the two years we had him, he was incredible; he scored 49 goals in 94 games and was probably the best signing of the lot."I thought he would fit in with the under-21 side.There was interest in Toney as Northampton struggled to pay their wages.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He came back and said: "Would you pay £200,000 for Ivan?"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I said: "Yes, of course."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Doig worked with Toney at the time.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doig worked with Ivan at the end of October and admitted that he struggled at times playing in a defensive team battling at the bottom of the table.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were rock bottom of League One and had only won one game in 15.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Ivan\'s loan expired in January, it was obvious that he was going to go somewhere else.He showed what he could do when we won a game at Millwall.He occupied their defence on his own.He was a handful if he was in the mood.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He had to wait for his chance because we had strikers in form, but his application in training was superb in that time."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he got his chance, he stayed in the team and he was different class.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carr was dismayed by the lack of value the club saw from his sale, despite stipulating a 30% sell-on clause in the deal.He might not have been ready for the first team but he was proving himself better than the under-21s.The price that they sold him for was a mistake.The coaching staff didn\'t think much of him."He proved them wrong," said Fry.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was wanted by Spurs as a back-up for Harry Kane, but Daniel Levy didn\'t sign him.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We couldn\'t wait because they asked to wait until the end of the window, which was extended until October.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the global crisis hadn\'t happened, we would have had more for him.I spoke to David Sullivan recently and he still wants to buy him.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was supposed to be in the team immediately.Brentford\'s automatic promotion hopes look slim, and after losing the play-off final last season, they will hope history doesn\'t repeat itself.He has a burning ambition to be the best centre forward in the premier league and will be a wanted man.I think he\'s going to get a chance to prove that with either Brentford or someone paying a lot of money for him.He will be the Golden Boot winner in a couple of years.&lt;p&gt;

0,5,&lt;p&gt;"Mark Selby won't chase snooker's all-time greats"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Mark Selby says he will not chase records set by the game\'s "all-time greats" after winning his fourth World Championship.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don\'t set my goals at any number as far as world titles go, I just come to the tournament every year to give my all."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s great if that is good enough.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will go back home and work harder if not.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can\'t predict winning any single tournament, never mind the World Championship, so I am not going to look at records like Hendry orRonnie and think \'he is at six, that\'s my aim, because you can\'t predict winning any single The last time that happened was in March of 2020 when the country was locked down due to the coronaviruses.His tally of nine Triple Crown events - the Masters, UK and World Championships - places him level with Scotland\'s Higgins and behind only Davis, Hendry and O\'Sullivan."Other people may talk about it but is not something I can get my head around," said the three-time world champion.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is the best all-rounder we have ever seen.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Selby has time on his side and could be the one to challenge Hendry\'s record," said Davis.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He\'s too good to stick on four titles.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ronnie is still playing to the highest standard at 45 and there is nothing to say that Mark Selby can\'t do the same," said pundit and Crucible record-holder Stephen Hendry.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\'m going to have to sweat about him and someone else.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;Lineker, Shearer and Richards rank the best centre-halves in the league&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Micah Richards discussed the best centre-halves to play in the premier league.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was with John Terry for much of his time at the London club, including the 2004-05 season when they conceded only 15 goals.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He's a top player because he won three Premier League titles.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was a great footballer, but he had a nasty side to him.There are a lot of these players that you think of and then think of their partner, he was obviously partnership with John Terry which was a great partnership.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He spent six years with the Blues after signing from AC Milan.He was part of the 1998 France team that won the World Cup, but he didn't win a title.He asked me why I wouldn't go and stand on him when I could stand on Frank.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was one of my greatest moments in punditry when he said that France has had some of the greatest players of all time, and he wasn't joking.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He helped Sir Alex Ferguson's side win their first Premier League title in 1993, as well as the 1990 FA Cup, which was his first trophy as United manager.He played in an unbelievable team at Manchester United, he and Bruce had a great partnership.He was an important part of the team that won the treble in 1999, as well as being an important part of the team that won the title in 1999.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only centre-half in this list is still playing at the top level.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has made 95 appearances for the club since he joined for a fee of £73m.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was part of the team that won the first top-flight title in almost 30 years last season.He has been missing this season because of his injury.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they want to knock it over the top, he can turn and be as quick as anyone, because they have this pressing game and they have the confidence in him that they can leave him one v one.We've seen them not pressing as much as they could and should because they don't feel confident without him.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He could be the greatest ever, maybe it's getting a bit late now in terms of age and he's had his injury but he had an instant impact - there's no question marks over him, he can do everything.I can't believe that Manchester City didn't take a punt on him when he was at Celtic.He helped them win the 2011 FA Cup, their first major trophy since 1976, as well as four Premier League titles and four League Cups, before returning to his hometown club Anderlecht.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was good in the middle of the field in his first game.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the games after that, he could do a good job in there, but when he went to centre-back, I thought 'WOW'.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He can be selfish at times, he is a perfectionist, and if you don't do things at his level he takes things to heart.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were a mess when he first arrived.The club was taken to the next level when the new owners came in.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was doing it because he wanted to be the best.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lineker is a scorer of vital goals at key moments in league winning seasons.The one against Manchester United was crucial.Shearer said that he was a winner.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and Vidic played together for much of his time at Manchester United.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I went to the England camp, Rio was like nothing, he was top notch.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything was easy for him because he was so relaxed on the ball.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He looked like a centre-half.He used to talk to me when I played for England, and for a senior professional to do that and talk you through the game it makes things so much easier.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Rolls Royce of a centre-half, elegant, could bring the ball out with pace, could start the move, could stop the move, clever, could read the game.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He won four top-flight titles, three FA Cups and two League Cups, butShearer said he had cut eyes, a broken nose and cut lip after a game against him.I think Ferdinand was the best centre-half I've played against, in that era, in terms of how aggressive he could be.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He played in the back four and had a great goalkeeper behind him.He was a leader, tackler, and also a tough one.I didn't mind playing against him because he was the best centre-half I've ever played against.The club captain won five Premier League titles with the Blues, along with five FA Cups, two League Cups, a Europa League and a Champions League.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He pinged balls with his left foot when you trained with him.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He played left side because he liked the ball there and he could ping a ball in with his left foot.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My best foot was better than his weak one."&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;Boris Johnson is fired up, but the path to victory looks risky&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Six of the 12 teams initially signed up to the new competition are from England, with three coming from Spain and Italy.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The league\'s contribution to the UK economy is worth over $10 billion and Johnson has more political skin in the game than his Spanish and Italian counterparts.Along with other European leaders, Johnson has come out strongly against the Super League.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The football authorities have his government\'s full backing to take whatever action is necessary to stop the plans.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the Premier League said it was considering all actions available to prevent a Super League from progressing.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement to Parliament on Monday, Johnson\'s Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden, made clear that this meant exploring some drastic measures.We are looking at governance reform, competition law, and the mechanisms that allow football to take place.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will be reviewing everything the Government does to support these clubs to play," he said.You\'d be forgiven for wondering why Johnson, a free market liberal with a long-standing objection to state interference, is suddenly considering going so far as passing legislation to "ensure these proposals are stopped."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theories have ranged from the PM having undergone a conversion since his days as London Mayor, when he warned against an "orgy of stable door banging and excessive regulation" for financial services, to cynical politics and trying to hang onto poorer voters he won in the general election.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reality is not very interesting.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In England, love of football is not confined to one part of the country or one set of seats, and I suspect this intervention will be near-universally popular," says Opinium Research\'s Chris Curtis."What is more interesting is the extent to which Johnson is willing Conservative Parliamentarians, many of whom have been spooked by Johnson\'s drift from free-market economics since becoming PM, seem comfortable with the current noises coming from Downing Street.Damian Collins, a Conservative MP and chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee, told CNN that while his preference would be an agreement between the governing bodies that forces the Super League to back down, the government must explore what legal options it has to stop English clubs from joining The Prime Minister wants to stop the Super League.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don\'t think it\'s right that clubs should be turned into international brands and commodities without any reference to the fans who have loved them all their lives," said Johnson.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson can only change the clubs\' minds through legal action and discouragement.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best option for Johnson is that the football authorities sanction clubs who join the Super League by preventing players from representing national teams or docking points in domestic leagues.Johnson would get the double victory of having made the right noises and keeping his hands clean.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson might need to look at removing state support for these clubs if this sort of discouragement isn\'t possible.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could include not giving police supervision at matches, or refusing visas for international players.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The messiest route for Johnson to take is taking legal action.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is possible that the government could use existing competition laws.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson may have to introduce legislation that would allow the government to intervene in businesses that are very wealthy.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is politically risky.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Good Law Project, a non-profit organization that uses law to protect public interest, says that the government could introduce legislation saying that these clubs may not join this league and that their directors will go to prison if they do.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would pass through parliament.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Germany, fans are the majority shareholder of football clubs.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There would be consequences.A majority of parliament in favor of state intervention in a key industry would have a huge impact on how foreign investors view the UK.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The backstop of the European Court of Justice is no longer in Johnson\'s possession.The EU cannot be used as a scapegoat to allow us to have our cake and eat it because of Britain\'s newfound sovereignty.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the football authorities don\'t do Johnson\'s job for him, the ultimate decision to take action that matches current rhetoric won\'t be easy.They will have to consider the legal consequences of how the government manages the sport industry.There will be a political aspect to those consequences.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His current fire breathing could do long-term damage to his reputation.It\'s always going to be popular for politicians to attack the financial interests of football clubs and institutions.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson\'s threats to end the Super League might not be very serious.They could give other people cover to not take action.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson is faced with a sincere step into the unknown if that happens.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He will have to take that step on his own.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;The players and fans condemn the European Super League&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;A banner that read "#saynotosuperleague" was flown over the ground before the game.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the pitch, the players wore shirts with the words "Football is for the fans" and "Earn it", a reference to teams having to qualify to play in the Champions League, which wouldn\'t be the case for founding clubs.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a new European league featuring top teams from England, Spain and Italy.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most teams involved in the competition, which could begin as early as later this year and generate more revenue than the current European competitions, would be permanent members.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It\'s amazing the things they\'re talking about, I can\'t quite comprehend them," said Patrick Bamford after Monday\'s game.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When someone\'s pockets are being hurt, it\'s amazing the amount of uproar that comes into the game.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I haven\'t seen a football fan who\'s happy about the decision and I think football is for the fans.Every club would be meaningless without the fans.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement of the Super League on Sunday sparked widespread condemnation from the football world and beyond, including from players.I don\'t like it, I can only say my personal opinion."Hopefully, it doesn\'t happen," James said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We\'re here to play football and have no control of it," said the manager of the side that is sixth in the league.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can\'t say a lot more about it because we weren\'t involved in the process and we didn\'t know about it.I like the fact that West Ham could play in the European competition next year.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don\'t want them to, to be honest, because we want to do that, but I like that they have the chance.In the first half, Sadio Mane opened the scoring for the visiting side when he turned Trent Alexander-Arnold\'s squared pass into an open net.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perez said that the game had to evolve as young audiences weren\'t interested in football anymore.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social media has changed how people interact with each other.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Football has to adapt to the times we live in.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most interest in the game is generated by the big clubs playing each other.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;Infantino warned the clubs that they must live with the consequences&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Infantino told clubs involved in the proposed break-up that they must live with the consequences.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infantino said there was a lot to throw away for a short-term financial gain.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They need to take responsibility.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shareholders are important, but they need to think of all the people as well.European football is what it is today because of all the fans.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There would be repercussions if players taking part in the proposed competition were banned from the World Cup."If they choose to go their own way, they have to live with the consequences of that choice," said Infantino, who was the General Secretary of the European soccer organization.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can\'t be both in and out.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new European Super League\'s announcement on Sunday has resulted in widespread criticism, with fans, players and even politicians concerned the new competition would rip the heart out of football as we currently know it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The league will consist of 20 teams and be governed by the founding clubs.The new structure would end competition at the highest level and make it almost impossible for smaller teams to break into Europe\'s elite.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said, "This is the magic of football, this bond from the bottom to the top and look at the success of the top."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ceferin said he was reassured last week that the new plans would be enough and was surprised to hear of the announcement on Sunday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\'ve met many tricky people that I\'ve represented but I\'ve never seen something like that.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s hard for me to call it Super League because it\'s all but super.It called on the clubs to reconsider their decision after rejecting the new proposals.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 14 clubs at the meeting unanimously and vigorously rejected the plans for the competition, and the league is considering all actions available to prevent it from progressing, as well as holding those Shareholders involved to account under its rules.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reaction proves how much our open pyramid and football community means to people.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statement from the club\'s board said that they were "saddened and disappointed to see proposals of a break-up league pushed forward by six clubs."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six clubs are acting in their own interests.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reputation of our league and the game has been damaged by six clubs.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six clubs sat around the table and disrespected every other club.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six clubs taking for granted and betraying the majority of football supporters across our country and beyond.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that Paris Saint-Germain believes that football is a game for everyone.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a football club, we are a family and a community; whose fabric is our fans - I believe we shouldn\'t forget this.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new plans have been discussed with representatives from the English Football Association, the Premier League and fan groups.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He expressed his solidarity with football fans and agreed they must always be at the heart of any decisions about the future of the game," the statement said.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;The world was shocked and appalled by the European Super League plans&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;In a joint announcement Sunday night, six English clubs, along with three teams from Italy, and three from Spain, were laid out.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spartak Moscow will welcome fans of the proposed European Super League if they jump ship.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wrote a letter to the fans of AC Milan, Atlético, Barcelona, Internazionale, Manchester City, Manchester United, Real Madrid and Spurs.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you need a new club to support, we\'re always here for you."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current Paris Saint-GermainMidfielder Ander Herrera became one of the first high-profile players to speak out on the European Super League.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those dreams are over if the European Super League advances.Kids dream of winning the World Cup and the Champions League, not the Super League.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big games only happen once or twice a year, not every week.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hans-Joachim Watzke said in a statement that the members of the board of the European Club Association rejected the plans.Gary believes the six English clubs should be docked points and fined if they go ahead with the plans."It\'s pure greed," he said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are not related to football in this country.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been 100 years of history in this country of fans who love these clubs.Football clubs in the National League are going bust and players are getting calls about breaking away.Take the money from them and put them at the bottom of the league."This is deeply troubling and damaging for football, in addition to the 12 founding members of the proposed Super League, the group plans to add three additional clubs before the Super League\'s inaugural."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clubs involved must answer to their fans and the wider footballing community before taking any further steps.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK Culture Secretary questioned the fairness of the proposed changes and stressed the focus of football is on the fans.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Football supporters are the heartbeat of our national sport and any major decisions made should have their support.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many fans are concerned that this plan could lead to a closed shop at the very top of our national game.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The integrity and fair competition of football are of paramount importance.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have a football pyramid where funds from the globally successful Premier League flow down the leagues and into local communities."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would be very disappointed to see that destroyed.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;"As he continues his historic scoring streak, Curry breaks Kobe Bryant's record"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;It might be a season of transition for the Golden State Warriors, yet two-time NBA Most Valuable Player has excelled and continued his record-breaking scoring streak on Monday night.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kobe Bryant\'s record for consecutive 30-point games by a player aged 33 or older was broken by Curry, who scored 49 points in his team\'s 107-96 win over the Philadelphia 76ers.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bryant\'s record of 10 points in a game was set in December 2012 and the three-time NBA champion has now scored more than 30 points in 11 straight games.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curly\'s run of form comes a week after he overtook Wilt Chamberlain as the Warriors\' all-time leading scorer.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You just play basketball and don\'t put too much pressure on yourself.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s kind of letting the game come to you.Curry is having a blast out there just playing basketball and it\'s obviously working.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His 49 points was his fifth 40-point game in April which passes Bryant and Michael Jordan for the most 40-point games in a month by a player aged 33 or older.With 47 and 49 points in his last two games, Curry became the first player aged 33 or older with back-to Curry\'s three-point range has been a factor in his success.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is second in the list behind Ray Allen.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last five games, Curry has made 46 three pointers with even more consistency.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In NBA history, no one has made more.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curry has hit at least 10 threes in six games this season.Curry is the only other player to have more than five in a career.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curry\'s hot streak is something that is "above and beyond" according to Warriors coach Steve Kerr."Obviously, Michael Jordan had some stretches where he just scored like crazy, but obviously nobody\'s ever shot the ball like this in the history of the game."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curry\'s recent play has helped the Warriors post their best stretch of the season, having won five of their past six games.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;The manager of Spurs was sacked&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The Portuguese manager was appointed by Spurs in November and had signed a deal until the end of the 2022-23 season.Spurs face Manchester City in the Carabao Cup Final at Wembley Stadium on Sunday with the club bidding to win its first piece of silverware in 13 years.The club was eliminated from the last-16 of the Europa League by Dinamo Zagreb.According to Opta, only one Portuguese side has a lower win ratio for a manager than Spurs do.Spurs have dropped more points from winning positions this season than any other side.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;Football fan groups condemn the betrayal of the European Super League&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Fifteen founding clubs and five other teams who would qualify each year based on achievements from the previous season are included in the new league announced by 12 of Europe\'s most prominent clubs.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our members and football supporters across the world have experienced the ultimate betrayal, a decision of greed to line the pockets of those at the top," said a statement from the Chelsea Supporters\' Trust.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American investment bank JP Morgan confirmed to CNN on Monday that it will be financing the new league.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of the clubs in the Super League are permanent members despite the fact that some may not qualify for European football next season.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The motivation behind this so-called superleague is not furthering sporting merit or nurturing the world\'s game -- it is motivated by nothing but cynical greed.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jere Virtanen, a lifelong Manchester United fan who owns a museum dedicated to the club in Finland, has traveled across Europe to watch his team play, but says he wouldn\'t attend Super League games if the tournament goes ahead.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Manchester United Football Club would not join the elite circle.I would be part of the problem if I attended that league.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the influence of billionaire owners continues to change football in Europe, Virtanen believes that the patience of loyal fans is being tested.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I hope this is a bad dream and the decision makers understand what football really means to us fans," he said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our tolerance and boundaries have been constantly stretched as the sport has become more popular.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Manchester United Supporters\' Trust said the concept of a "closed shop of self-selected wealthy clubs goes against everything football, and Manchester United."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We feel betrayed with a plan like this to be hatched without any consultation with supporters," said Martin Buhagiar, a board member of the THST.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The club\'s owners knew this would be a reaction.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They knew it would have the look and feel of a deal done in dark quarters, behind closed doors, with no regard for the largest stakeholders in the game, the most important people in football.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe that the concept of a European Super League would destroy this dream."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That sentiment was echoed by Spain\'s La Liga, which said the elitist nature of the Super League "attacks the principles of open competition and sporting merit which are at the heart of the domestic and European football The dream of shutting the door to the top of European football was destroyed by the concept proposed by 12 European clubs.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;How will the new European Super League work?&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;There is a rundown of what you need to know about the plans and why they matter.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;15 founding teams would be permanent members of the league.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s not clear if those five clubs would be demoted regardless of their performance.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clubs involved include the traditional "Big Six" of the Premier League, as well as Spanish giants Real Madrid, Barcelona and Atlético Madrid.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hans-Joachim Watzke, the chairman of the club, said that the club was against the formation of the European Club Association.Football writers and analysts believe that the timing of the declaration of plans for the ESL could be a way for the top European clubs to negotiate a bigger piece of the pie for the top European clubs.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing is awful and owners are exploiting a weakened system.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Football is losing money and is under threat without fans in attendance for over a year.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The owners of the world\'s biggest clubs have long agitated for a bigger share of football\'s TV revenues and other financial rewards.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan confirmed to CNN on Monday that it will be financing the proposed new European Super League, but declined to say how much money is involved.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new annual tournament will provide significant economic growth and support for European football.solidarity payments are expected to be in excess of 10 billion during the initial commitment period of the clubs.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the growth of powerful tech giants and popular streaming services such as Apple TV+, Netflix, and Amazon\'s Prime Video, the new ESL competition could provide a similar opportunity for such platforms to enter the European sporting market, while also increasing the huge financial broadcast deals that have continued to grow The condemnation of proposals has been widespread.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"FIFA can only express its disapproval to a closed European league outside of the international football structures and not respecting the aforementioned principles," the statement said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the world\'s best players wouldn\'t be allowed to participate in any competition organized by FIFA or their respective confederation if a previous statement is to be believed.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Football is based on open competition and sporting merit; it cannot be any other way.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The England\'s Football Association believes that the concept of a European Super League would destroy this dream.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clubs involved must answer to their fans and the wider footballing community before taking any further steps.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;The clubs planning a new Super League are taking football hostage&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Ceferin did not hold back on the proposals which threaten to rock the foundations of the sport but was confident the new league would not be a success.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because we respect the fans, traditions, football, the football community, our society, we will win.""If 12 people want to take football hostage, just to fill their pockets that are already so full that it\'s hard to put anything in, they can\'t win."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a joint announcement Sunday, six English clubs, along with three teams from Italy, and three from Spain, said they can\'t win long term.Fans are not for sale and football players as well. eferin said he had been reassured by both Manchester United and Juventus that neither club would sign up to the new structure.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was angry with Agnelli, who he said had been ignoring his calls since rumors of the major announcement were circulating.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought we were also friends.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For me, it\'s always better to be naive than to lie all the time," Ceferin said, previously referring to those involved as "snakes."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They didn\'t want to comment on the comments.The president of European football\'s governing body said in a press conference Monday that any players involved in the proposed break-up will be banned from the World Cup and European Championships.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are three teams currently signed up to the new Super League that will compete in this year\'s Champions League semifinals.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total number of teams will increase from 32 to 36 with the traditional group stage being changed into a single league stage.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new format was supposed to hold off the new Super League.I\'ve met many tricky people that I\'ve represented but I\'ve never seen something like that.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ceferin said ethics doesn\'t exist in the group.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s hard for me to call it Super League.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new structure of the European Super League is intended to commence as soon as is practicable, according to the announcement posted on the 12 clubs\' websites.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five qualification places would be available each year, but there wouldn\'t be promotion from the league.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new structure would end competition at the highest level and make it almost impossible for smaller teams to break into Europe\'s elite, shattering the sport\'s long-standing ethos.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bringing together the world\'s greatest clubs and players to play each other throughout the season will open a new chapter for European football, ensuring world-class competition and facilities, and increased financial support for the wider football pyramid," he said in a statement.American investment bank JP Morgan confirmed to CNN on Monday that it will be financing the proposed tournament.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The formation of the Super League was denounced by the global governing body for football, which said it goes against its core principles of inclusivity, solidarity, integrity and equitable financial redistribution.In a statement issued in January, after rumors of the new Super League began circulating, FIFA said that it would.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will consider all measures available to us, at all levels, both judicial and sporting, in order to prevent this happening."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No German or French club has yet signed up to the Super League, which is based on open competition and sporting merit.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christian Seifert is the CEO of the German Football Association.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The abolishment of established structures in European football should not be a consequence of the economic interest of a few top clubs in England, Italy, and Spain.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Super League plan is a blow to the hopes of millions of soccer fans who support smaller clubs in England and around Europe."We believe that the concept of a European Super League would destroy this dream, it is clear that this would be damaging to English and European football at all levels and will attack the principles of open competition and sporting merit which are fundamental to competitive sport."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president of the Republic welcomed the position of French clubs to refuse to participate in a European football Super League project that threatens the principle of solidarity and sporting merit.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Super League announcement said that change was needed to sustain the sport, which has seen revenues.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;"The actor's wife injected soccer into his blood"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;In 1993, he delivered an ad-libbed line, "Alright, alright, alright!", that would stay with him throughout his career and is now going to feature prominently in a new venture that he could never have imagined when he was cast as David Wooderson.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the new season, Austin supporters are chanting those words to the tune of "Olé, olé, olé!", as theyTrademarkiaTrademarkiaTrademarkiaTrademarkiaTrademarkiaTrademarkiaTrademarkiaTrademarkiaTrademarkiaTrademarkiaTrademarkiaTrademarkiaTrademarkiaTrademarkiaTrademarkiaTrademarkiaTrademarkiaTrademarkiaTrademarkiaTrademarkiaTrademarkiaTrademarkiaTrademarkiaTrademarkiaTrademarkiaTrademarkiaTrademarkiaTrademarkiaTrademarkia "If you said that night, \'That line you just threw out of your mouth, someone\'s going to be chanting that 30 years from now and it\'s going to be the supporter\', that\'s going to be the trajectory of those three little words," He\'s talked passionately about his love for the Washington Football Team in the NFL and he\'s often been seen on the sideline of the Texas Longhorn.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went to a camp with the Rowdies.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was not that good.I led the league in red cards.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn\'t the quintessential American game back then, so I had interest, but it wasn\'t my game.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow!&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He describes his marriage to a supporter of the five-time World Cup winners as akin to having "soccer injected into my blood\', adding that their three children have now made his passion of the game even stronger.There is a soccer ball.You can go to anyone.You don\'t have to say your name or introduce yourself.The ball will come to you if you put a foot out.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are not at the international level yet, but we are on our way.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If soccer isn\'t the new sport in America, it\'s the sport in the new America," he says.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beauty of sport is that.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He could be talking about Austin FC\'s first game of the new season against LAFC on Saturday, his beloved Longhorns or something much closer to home.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He compares the two forms of entertainment and concludes that sport is the winner.The prescribed script of how it will go down is already in second place, because it wasn\'t live.You are not defined by being an athlete.It would be like someone said: "Matthew, you shouldn\'t consider anything political because you\'re an actor and a storyteller.""Is there a way to get there?" asks the actor.I don\'t know if there is a line.If you want to boycott or protest, know your reasons, develop them, and evolve them along the way.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;Trekking 4,000 km along the Australian coast on a skateboard&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;You probably wouldn\'t have known that he was a long way from home, skating alone on an epic voyage of discovery that led him from Melbourne all the way north to Cairns, a 4,000-kilometer route on just four little wheels.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He didn\'t know what would be possible when he set off.When asked where he was going, he replied, "As far up as possible!" but it soon became a daring attempt to traverse almost the whole side of a continent.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started skateboarding to clear my head.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn\'t know; I was just looking for an adventure, and I took my board a little further out.Friends and family were initially skeptical of his early ambitions and he thought they might have been right.When I first told them I was going to skateboard, it was like, \'whatever.\' But when I started this trip, I thought, \'This is so stupid!\' I was exhausted, and my body.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was a diamond driller in his hometown mine, working 1,400m below the surface of the earth.It was the hardest job he\'s ever had.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He described it as "hard and dirty" in hot conditions.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I knew if I could work there 12 hours a day then I could skate 12 hours a day in the sun!"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will get into the rhythm after that.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He catalogued some of the occupational dangers of a trans-continental skateboarder: "Fallen off twice."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three times, there was severe chafe.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost stepped on four snakes.Went into the police five times.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Had heatstroke six times.He did anything from 50 to 100 kilometers a day.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He traveled 115 km on one occasion and was on his board for 15 hours.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The traffic has been difficult on the highways.There are loads of double-trailer semi-trucks that are speeding by me.I\'ve always been on the lookout for rocks and sticks and snakes on the road.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hated hills when I started the trip, but now I love them because they give me a break.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love flying down the hills with my music on.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While detailing the more challenging aspects of the journey, he makes no attempt to sugarcoat the intense heat of the Australian summer.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average temperature throughout his journey was around 33 degrees Celsius.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The temperature was much higher on the stretch between Gin Gin and Miriam Vale.The sun was screaming at me as it was hot.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was shaking so violently that I thought I was going to be in trouble if I didn\'t find shade.I\'m in the middle of nowhere.I was so stressed, my body and mind were so nauseated, I burst into tears.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sights and sounds of Drury\'s travels are laid out in a presentation on his social media page.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He\'s stayed with many of them and now considers them friends.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that they live in fear, not just of people but of the elements.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My mental health has never been better since I\'ve started this trip; I\'m feeling so clear and I\'m feeling so in touch with nature and people in general."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\'ll never tell myself that I won\'t be able to do anything again, because I\'ve blown everyone\'s minds by coming up here on my skateboard.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He\'s been raising money to build a skate park in Laos, which is the only country in Southeast Asia that doesn\'t have one.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donations will support classes and maintenance.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He admits that he\'s been homesick and can\'t wait for life to return to normal.He plans to head back to Broken Hill in search of a new job and though he\'ll never try anything like his marathon skateboarding trek again, he\'d definitely recommend the experience to anyone.He believes that he\'s the first person to skateboard so far north in Australia but doesn\'t think it\'s a record because others have done it before.To be honest.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;By not taking a knee, cricket raised a finger&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The editor of the Wisden Cricketers\' Almanack wrote in his notes that the sport lost its nerve over time.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The England and the West Indian cricket teams knelt on July 8 last year in the aftermath of George Floyd\'s death at the hands of a policeman in the US.On the same day, former West Indian cricketer and now commentator Michael Holding gave an emotional speech about his own experience of racism.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a time to reflect.The trickle became a torrent as players past and present began to tell stories of prejudice.The rule of thumb was that if you weren\'t White, you had suffered.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless there is money to be made, cricket isn\'t fond of radicalism.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It lost its nerve.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cricket has been here before: a sympathetic ear, a pat on the shoulder, a promise that things will change.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They never do, but this time they have to.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If cricket\'s response to racism is expedience rather than repudiation, everyone loses.The "bible of cricket" is the Wisden Cricketers\' Almanack, which names five cricketers of the year, alongside its leading cricketer in the world.The leading cricketer in the world for the second year in a row was England\'s Ben Stokes, who was also named cricketers of the year.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australia\'s first international cricket team found fame in the UK.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were cases of alleged racism in England, including an instance in which a Yorkshire player called an Indian player "Steve" because they found his name too difficult.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Azeem Rafiq, a former Yorkshire player, accused the county cricket team of racism.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yorkshire County Cricket Club said it has taken the claims very seriously.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Racism has no place in our society or our sport," it said.An independent law firm began an investigation in September of last year into the claims made by Azeem Rafiq.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a very important investigation to the club and to our sport, and we have committed to a full and thorough process to provide an in-depth set of recommendations which we will publish in the coming weeks."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Anti-Discrimination Code of Conduct sends a clear message that discrimination will not be accepted.Over the coming months we will build on the actions already taken to launch a number of new initiatives that will help us in our next step towards making cricket a truly inclusive and diverse sport.&lt;p&gt;

talks to CNN Sport, she\'s on a high from finishing the first leg of an intense training season in Tuscany for the Liv Racing WorldTeam, with her membership as a satellite rider for the 11-person roster announced in February 2021.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The athlete, who will prepare for the next few months with the goal of racing and becoming a pro road cyclist after August 1, says it didn\'t feel real until he was on his way to training camp.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She tells CNN that she feels a lot of pressure from herself to push harder.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She became the first Black American woman in pro cycling because of her stubbornness.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is descended from a long line of matriarchs, including her grandmother, mother and older sister.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I set my sights on something and wasn\'t willing to stop until I got it," she says as she remembers cycling on her grandparents\' expansive land in Georgia.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She started seeing cycling as a competitive sport in the mid-twenties.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She graduated from the Berklee College of Music in 2010 with her principal instrument being the violin.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She became a music teacher after working at a daycare center for five years.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She made her debut at the Red Hook Women\'s Field in Brooklyn after being commuted for seven years.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She won the Category 4 race at the New York State Criterium Championships.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until that point, it was just a form of transportation, freedom and fun.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She says that it still is, but also that competitive aspect.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Union Cycliste Internationale, the sport\'s governing body, told CNN Sport that it does not have a breakdown of the ethnicities of cyclists currently competing.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UCI allocated six million Swiss Francs ($6.5 million) to push for diversity in cycling worldwide in 2019.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s no surprise that he\'s riding for the Liv team.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonnie Tu is the chairperson of the Giant Group and is the founder of the women\'s cycling brand.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite industry-led efforts to encourage greater global participation in the sport, McGowan quickly became aware of bike racing\'s gender disparity when she started cycling.In 2015, she started A Quick Brown Fox, a website where she encourages more women and ethnic minority people to engage with the sport.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She decided to support herself through advocacy work and training after three years.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has gained nearly 40,000 followers on her social media accounts, which she uses to facilitate conversations about race, racism and sexism in the world of cycling and beyond.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can\'t fight for women and not fight for Black women, trans women, disabled women, or any of the other intersections where any one who identifies as a woman resides," she wrote in an essay for the US-based cycling firm.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has used her platform to create a space where people from marginalized background can exist in their fullest capacity, without diminishing parts of their identity.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She tells CNN that people of color are taught to diminish themselves to make other people feel comfortable.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don\'t think I\'ve ever been in a place where I didn\'t see myself as black.She says that it was ingrained in her family and that they have a lot of pride in who they are.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Joe Biden became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the state in 28 years when he was elected in January.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We see the power of collective community, and so there\'s usually a push to organize not just Black women, but everybody to work together to make things better for everyone."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Maybe it\'s because we\'re left out of everything," she says.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is committed to holding the people in power to account because of the different presidencies she has lived under.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think people are relieved to not have to deal with the constant insanity that came with our previous president, that we\'re not as engaged as we need to be," she says.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McGowan voted for Barack Obama, who was the first black president of the US, and he wants Joe Biden to stay true to his platform.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She tells CNN that it\'s important to see people through a full lens and not through glasses.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Biden entered the second month of his presidency, Republican state lawmakers passed a new Georgia law that advocates say could suppress the votes of Democratic and Black citizens.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that athletes in the public eye usually have a platform.I don\'t think they need to go on the campaign trail, but I do believe in the power of the platform.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When fighting becomes tiring, it\'s because of the slow rate of change.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s the toughest part for me.She says that a lot of the things she is working toward are things people in power know, but they don\'t care enough to do anything.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of a movement to declare that Black Lives Matter shouldn\'t exist, but it needs to because we have been shown that Black lives don\'t matter.When she sees other Black women athletes succeed in their chosen fields, she feels inspired.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She remembers watching a gymnast at the 1996 Olympics.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She says that she wanted to become a gymnast because of the Williams sisters and others.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She sees people like Jools Walker and Rachel Olzer as her role models in cycling.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thee Abundance Summit is a virtual meeting of Black and Brown people in cycling and outdoor communities.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She says that the summit exists because there are so many amazing people that are doing amazing things in cycling and the outdoors.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she first began racing, her ambitions were just as great as they are now.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She says she doesn\'t think being in this position as a Black woman is enough to represent well.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it isn\'t in the name of finding joy, happiness and peace in the things we love, none of this is worth it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want people to be comfortable, safe and happy here and that\'s why I want more representation and equity in cycling.She says that the thing they\'re working for is thriving in a space.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;"Lionel Messi's wingman at Barcelona is Martin Braithwaite, who spent time in a wheelchair as a child"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"I don\'t have a lot of memories because it\'s such a sad moment," Martin Braithwaite recently told CNN Sport, "You\'re looking at all the other kids running around, smiling, playing."It hurt.Braithwaite had a hip disorder called Legg-Calvé-Perthes, which could have led to deformities in his femur, when he was five and seven years old.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wants to be a professional footballer at one of the top clubs in the world.Braithwaite has described what happened between then and now as a "hell of a journey" which took him out of that.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to explain Barcelona\'s success in recent years, but a key one is La Masia, the youth academy, which has produced some of the greatest players in the history of the game.The three were all products of the academy.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s not the only route into the first team at the Nou Camp Stadium; dazzling performances on the world stage will also catch the eye of the Barcelona scouts.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn\'t have anything else in mind when I was young.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When there is no plan B, you don\'t get distracted.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Braithwaite signed a youth contract with his hometown club in Danes, Esbjerg, before moving to the French league with Toulouse.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He spent time at another French club, Bordeaux, as well as a second tier club in England, where he struggled to make an impact.One of the most important phone calls of Braithwaite\'s life was when his agent told him that Barcelona was interested in him.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said they were really interested.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It felt amazing, but more than a decade in the professional game had prepared Braithwaite to manage his expectations.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When there\'s interest, it doesn\'t mean anything.There\'s still a long way to go for you to sign the papers.He trained and played for Leganes and hid the negotiations from his wife.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\'m hiding the phone calls from my wife.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cat was already out of the bag when he felt confident enough to reveal what he\'d been up to.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She smiled and said, \'I know what you\'re going to tell me,\'" recalls Braithwaite of his wife being hit up with messages on her phone about the transfer.The significance of his achievement wasn\'t lost on his family, despite the fact that the surprise was spoiled.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She\'s seen all the sacrifice for me to get here.He never doubted that he could play for one of the big teams in Europe.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They told me that I have the mindset to play in a big club with a lot of pressure.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back at it now, it shows they were correct.Braithwaite only played in front of a big crowd twice in his three games with the Catalans.Since the departure of Luis Surez to FC Barcelona, Braithwaite has taken over the coveted number nine #9 shirt previously worn by the Brazilian greatRonaldo and Cameroonian Samuel Eto.Braithwaite, who is the son of a Guyanese father and a Danes mother, said that Danes are a bit more humble, down to earth, and don\'t dream too big.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\'ve been jumping up my performances.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Braithwaite is hoping that Messi will stay at Barcelona, the Argentine star tried to leave at the end of last season and could walk when his contract is up this summer.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features and videos.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Temple 1 is focused on helping minority entrepreneurs incubate business ideas, receive mentorship, be introduced to strategic partners and have the chance to receive investment.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with Michael, who Braithwaite describes more like an older brother, they\'ve also created NYCE Companies, which are on a mission to reduce the wealth gap.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black, Indigenous, and People of Color are referred to as BIPOC.Braithwaite wants to teach people about financial freedom and power.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have so many things that we want to do and always with the mindset to give back."Braithwaite knows what it is to suffer and he has felt the urge to help out when he can.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says that when he sees people in similar situations, he knows what they are going through.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;Women are helping to change golf&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The year is 2012 and the stars of the show are 1,500 seven and eight-year-old golf prodigies representing 60 different countries, all vying for a chance to become a U.S. Kids World Champion at the daunting Pinehurst course.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s not all about winning, it\'s about getting kids into golf.When it was released in 2013, Augusta National had only just accepted its first two female members the previous year in former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and financier and philanthropist Darla Moore.There are two tournaments at Augusta before the Masters in April, the Drive, Chip and Putt and the Augusta National Women\'s Amateur.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to be the first woman to play a tournament at Augusta.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we first meet her in the documentary, she says girls are just as good as boys.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is the last to leave the range and she is doing push-ups and sit-ups with her dad and sister.She is going to the University of Southern California next year on a golf scholarship and knows the meaning of hard yards.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although neither player made the Saturday finale at Augusta in the 54-hole event, the first two rounds take place.It was motivating to want to come back this year, as evidenced by the fact that women\'s golf icon and International Golf Federation president Annika Sorenstam made her first competitive appearance in 13 years.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current momentum around women\'s golf is perhaps something that Pano\'s grandmother, seen in "The Short Game" superstitiously clutching a packet of Mentos to bring luck to the youngster, saw on the horizon before she died in 2013, just after a fourth USK World Championship title Five years before the ANWA was announced, her grandmother said there would be a women\'s tournament at Augusta.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ANWA is the most watched amateur golf event in the US since 2003 and the most watched women\'s golf event in the last two years."It has been great, it has been exposed to the biggest stage from a very young age," said Sorenstam.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All that any woman golfer wants is for the attention to be on their golf, and I think everyone out here has had to overcome their own battle.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carlota Ciganda was the European Solheim Cup winner who she played alongside as the Spaniard triumphed on the Cactus Tour in February 2020.When I\'m done playing, I want to be a part of the business side and help it along.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman wants that to change because she listens to upbeat music, likes rapper Drake, and enjoys cooking during the apocalypse.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She shares a December 30 birthday with five-time Masters champion Woods and her initials ANA have brought past success at the ANA Inspiration host course.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a connection between golf and music, as evidenced by the co-founding of Modest!&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inaugural ISPS Handa WorldInvitational in Northern Ireland in July will feature a mixed field and is intended to help liven up the sport.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can inspire if they are seen.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angel Yin is 22 and has already competed in two Solheim Cups, she played the US Open aged 13 and she\'s a young superstar, but it\'s amazing.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They all mentioned a male sports star.I would want my daughter to have icons of people to look up to.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the most successful people in sport and business are women.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message we\'re going to continue to drive is that, "That\'s our humble opinion and that\'s the message we\'re going to continue to drive."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the LPGA/USGA Girls Golf initiative increasing participation by more than 1,800% from 2010-2020 among females aged six It was the main thing we wanted to come out of it, and when I get to meet them in person they say that is the best feeling.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;"Hideki Matsuyama's caddie bowed respectfully to Augusta in honor of his Masters win"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of Sunday\'s success, Shota Hayafuji, Matsuyama\'s caddie, collected the flag from the 18th hole and then turned to face the fairway, removing his hat and bow.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When the final putt went in, I really wasn\'t thinking of anything," Matsuyama told the media during his post-round press conference.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He slipped on the Green Jacket and held the famous trophy, which depicts the joy of being a Masters champion.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the moment of Matsuyama\'s victory, the commentator exclaimed "Japanese has become the top of the world!" before bursting into tears.Hopefully the youngsters who are playing golf or thinking about playing golf, I hope they will see this victory and think it\'s cool and try to follow in my footsteps.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Up until now, we haven\'t had a major champion in Japan, and maybe a lot of golfers or younger golfers, too, thought, well, maybe that\'s an impossibility."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully that will set an example for them that it is possible and that if they set their mind to it, they can do it as well.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the Olympics coming to his homeland later this year, pressure will be on his shoulders to bring home the gold medal.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matsuyama hopes that when they get a little older, some of them will be competing on the world stage.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully they will follow in my footsteps, I\'m happy for them.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;Hideki Matsuyama is the first Japanese man to win a golf major&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"The Japanese golfer won his first major.He shot a final round 73 to finish with a score of 10 under par, one shot ahead of the American runner-up.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As is tradition, last year's winner, who failed to make the cut this year after suffering his own struggles, presented Matsuyama with his Green Jacket, which etched him into Masters and golfing folklore.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matsuyama expressed his happiness that he could blaze a trail for other future Japanese golfers while sitting alongside Johnson and his translator.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he was happy.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My nerves did not start on the second nine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was right from the beginning and right to the end.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about my family all day and I'm happy I played well for them.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope that I will be a pioneer for many other Japanese people.Rose's brilliant opening round stole the headlines on Thursday, but Matsuyama was just a few shots behind.On Friday, the winds were swirling and the greens were fast, but on Saturday, the Japanese golfer put his pedal to the metal.Matsuyama hit his straps after the weather stopped play for about an hour.He had a four-shot lead with just 18 holes to play after hitting four birdies, an eagle and no bogeys in the final eight holes.The youngster who impressed in his Masters debut, Zalatoris, briefly reduced the deficit to one shot before Matsuyama found his rhythm.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He tied for second at the US Open in 2017, his previous best at a major.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matsuyama is the first Japanese man to win a golf major, but two of his female counterparts have already done it.The Women's British Open was won by Hinako Shibuno, while the 1977 LPGA Championship was won by Chako Higuchi.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tsubasa Kajitani won the Augusta National Women's Amateur eight days before Matsuyama won the Masters.He said that Japan was proud of Hideki.It's a huge accomplishment for you and your country.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is the first one in Japan.I think it's amazing."&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;"Lyon had a stranglehold on the Women's European League"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"One of the most dominant dynasties in modern football came to an end with Paris Saint-Germain's stunning comeback against Lyon.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the dying moments of the game, it appeared that Lyon would continue its winning streak.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renard's flick in the box found its way to Malard in front of goal, but the forward's effort was inexplicably kept out by the glove of Endler.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three of Lyon's players put their heads in their hands and Malard shot.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After dethroning the team many thought to be unbeatable, PSG will arguably be the favorite to go on and win this season's competition.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barcelona is the current Spanish league leader and is one of the most in-form teams in Europe.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Catalan club is currently 14 points ahead of second place Levante, winning all 23 of its games so far this season.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team has scored an astonishing 119 goals in those games and conceded just four.Though the outcome to this season's competition may yet be unknown, what is for"&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;Is this the end?Barcelona teammates line up for photos with Lionel Messi&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Messi stole the show as members of the squad took it in turns to pose with the trophy.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was Barcelona\'s third goal, Messi\'s first, that this game will be remembered for, as it was the first time in his career that he had scored.Messi dribbled between two Bilbao defenders and calmly stroked the ball into the bottom corner after being found inside the penalty area.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The club has not won a major trophy since 1984.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four of those final defeats have been against Barcelona and Messi has scored in each of them.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was Messi\'s 35th trophy with Barcelona, but it may also be his last after the final of the 2020 competition was postponed due to the coronaviruses.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the season started, Messi made it public that he had wanted to leave Barcelona "all year" and it remains to be seen whether the team\'s recent resurgence has changed his mind.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was genuine joy on his face as he hoisted the trophy above his head.It\'s very special to be able to lift the cup.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;Pierre-Emerick had contracted Malaria while on international duty&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The player returned to Gabon at the end of March to play in a qualification game for the Africa Cup of Nations.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He came back to England and played against Slavia Prague in the first leg of the quarterfinals of the Europa League.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for all the calls and messages.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately, I contracted Malaria while being on national team duty in Gabon a few weeks ago, but I\'m already feeling better every day, thanks to the great doctors that detected and treated the virus."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wasn\'t feeling well the last couple weeks, but will be back stronger than ever soon!Will be watching the game with my boys.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malaria, which is transmitted through the bite of female Anopheles mosquitoes, is both a preventable and treatable disease, yet 409,000 people died of it in 2019.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He will need a few days to recover from that."He wants to be back as soon as possible, that\'s what he said to me."Nicolas Pepe opened the scoring for the Czech side before the other two scored.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incident occurred late in the match when Kudela was seen saying something into Kamara\'s ear with his hand covering his mouth.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lacazette knelt in front of the opposition and gazed directly at them.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The players asked Arteta and the club to kneel in solidarity with Black Lives Matter."They wanted to take that initiative and they had the right reasons for it, so the club and I were very supportive."The office of Czech President Milos Zeman strongly condemned the 10-match ban handed down to Kudela.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wrote that you were able to unite old rivals even temporarily.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president of the Czech Republic had been informed of the situation and expressed his sympathy with those who were disappointed by the decision.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;The French Open was postponed by a week&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The second grand slam of the year was originally scheduled to take place from Monday 17 May to Sunday 6 June, but France has recently entered a new lockdown with a series new national restrictions in place.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the French Health Ministry reported the number of people in intensive care units with Covid-19 in France reached a new 2021 record of 5,729.The decision to delay the start of the French Open by one week has been made in the context of recently heightened COVID-19 restrictions in France, with the additional time improving the likelihood of enhanced conditions and ability to welcome fans at the event.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The updates will be communicated in due course.&lt;p&gt;

0,5,&lt;p&gt;Brooklyn Nets forward LaMarcus Aldridge is no longer with the team&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The 35-year-old announced his decision on social media, saying: "My last game, I played while dealing with an irregular heartbeat."The 15-year NBA veteran center wrote about the support he received from teammates to get to the hospital for a health check, even though he was better now.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He made the difficult decision to retire from the NBA.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For 15 years, I\'ve put basketball first, and now, it is time to put my health and family first."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You wanted me for something.You asked me to just do what I do and that was good to hear.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I\'m sorry it didn\'t last long, but I\'ve definitely had fun being a part of this special group," he said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sean Marks, general manager of the Nets, said: "We know this was not an easy decision for him, but after careful consideration and consultation with numerous medical experts, he made the best decision for him."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his time in Portland, any success we experienced would not have been possible without his work ethic, dedication and talent.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"During his nine seasons in Portland, LaMarcus battled through multiple injuries and health concerns but never once allowed them to affect his commitment to his teammates and coaches on the court or the people that benefited from his outreach in the community off the court."He will go down as one of the best players in the history of the franchise and while it is sad to see his career cut short, he will always be a member of the Trail Blazer family.While playing for the Trail Blazers in 2007, he was diagnosed with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome, a condition that causes the heart to beat fast for periods of time.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After further exams and consultations with experts in the field, Aldridge was cleared to resume basketball activities.&lt;p&gt;

0,5,&lt;p&gt;The first no-hitter in San Diego Padres history was thrown by a hometown pitcher&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The Padres are the only team in Major League Baseball that has never thrown a no-hitter.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Musgrove struck out 10 and only allowed one base runner when he hit Joey Gallo, which prevented a perfect game.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I looked up at the score to see what the pitch count was, and I was at 67, and I was like, we\'ve got some room to work with."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\'ve never thrown a no-hitter before.It comes on a big league stage and in a Padres uniform, it\'s pretty crazy, according to the team.Musgrove grew up in El Cajon, a suburb of San Diego, and attended games at the Padres\' Petco Park, according to the team.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will always be recognized as the first one to do it.I think a no-hitter regardless of where you\'re playing is really special, but it almost seems like this was meant to be.Padres manager Jayce Tingler said it was a special night.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;Lewis Hamilton is ahead of Max Verstappen&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The win was the 11th of the Dutch youngster\'s career and it was very challenging out there, especially in the beginning to stay on track.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I\'m grateful I was able to bring the car home today," said Hamilton.McLaren\'s Lando Norris completed the top three in the first time two British drivers had stood together on the podium since 2012.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verstappen seized the lead into turn two on the opening lap, forcing his way through with a great start from third on the grid, but making contact with the Mercedes as he went.&lt;p&gt;

0,5,&lt;p&gt;"Alonso's comeback race was ruined by a sandwich wrapper"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"After the second stop, a sandwich wrap paper got stuck inside the rear brake duct of Fernando's car, which led to high temperatures and caused some damage to the brake system.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 39-year-old said it was disappointing to not see the chequered flag in the end.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of last year's grands prix were behind closed doors and Lewis Hamilton said it was good to see fans out here."&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;"Less than 1% of Japan's population have been immunizedThat's a problem"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Barbara Holthus, director of Sophia University\'s German Institute, said that they don\'t talk about vaccines, they don\'t even talk about us being tested.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country passed half a million coronavirus cases on Saturday, and some prefectures are again increasing their Covid-19 restrictions.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hideaki Oka, a professor at Saitama Medical University, said Japan may not be able to contain the latest wave before the Games begin on July 23.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only a small number of people have received two doses.Holthus said supporting the Games was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.Tokyo 2020 organizers said in a statement to CNN that they were preparing to hold "a safe and secure Games without presuming there will be a vaccine and even without vaccines."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Kyodo News, senior citizens only began to receive their doses on April 12.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine skepticism that has damaged previous vaccination efforts in Japan is part of the reason for the delay.China has given out over 170 million vaccinations and India has given out over 100 million.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They say elderly citizens are supposed to have a vaccine by June, but in reality, even medical staff who is treating Covid hasn\'t got vaccine yet," said Oka from Saitama Medical University.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 11,000 athletes from over 200 countries are expected to participate.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holthus said that Tokyo 2020 President Hashimoto Seiko told volunteers that she was relying on their smile to make the Olympics a success.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holthus, who is scheduled to volunteer as a ticket collector, wondered if he was kidding when he was told that his smile was going to make the Olympics exist.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said she was scared after the presentation.The volunteer, who had taken part in previous Olympics, said she was considering dropping out.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that not doing so was showing disregard for our lives and the optimal safe environment that Japan as a host country is obligated to provide.Questions about the content of the presentation given to volunteers were not responded to by Tokyo 2020.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some players at the Australian Open complained on social media about the strict health screening measures they encountered.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was an outbreak of Covid-19 in the city and spectators were banned for several days.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hugs and high-fives should be avoided and public transport should not be used.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tokyo 2020 organizers did not respond to questions about how social distancing measures would be maintained at the Olympic village.While athletes in the Olympic village will have all tested negative before arriving in Japan, they will inevitably come in contact with tens of thousands of untested volunteers who will be shuttling between the Olympic venues and their homes.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When volunteering for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, volunteers should take public transport.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 510 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Tokyo on Tuesday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement to CNN, Tokyo 2020 said it had published a leaflet to inform volunteers about Covid, including mask wearing, washing hands and keeping a safe distance from others.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Groups of people from all over the world are going to mix together.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if there is a cluster in one of the Olympic venues?She wondered if it came from one of us.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Games could enable the spread of dangerous Covid-19 variant not only through Japan, but around the world, according to the Saitama Medical University professor."As an infectious disease specialist, I cannot approve of holding the Games in a situation where not enough vaccinations has been made and enough countermeasures put in place," he said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As we prepare to deliver a safe and secure Games this summer, we will continue to work closely with these parties," the statement said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Japanese love to watch history.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Olympics are going to be a very different event.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that he was looking forward to that.Holthus said she didn\'t think the Games should go ahead because of the current state of preparation.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The damage will be done after the games are over.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s not possible to turn that back once everyone flies in.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;The USA is expected to top the Tokyo Olympics medal table&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"The USA is predicted to win 114 medals in the Olympics in Tokyo, according to an analysis by sports data company Gracenote.Japan, Netherlands, France and Australia are predicted to finish ahead of Great Britain in the medal table in Tokyo.Japan's predicted tally of 59 medals would be a 40% improvement on its Rio total, according to Gracenote, while the Netherlands is forecast to comfortably beat its best-ever haul of 25 medals with 46 in Tokyo.Uncertainty has surrounded the upcoming Olympics since they were postponed until 2021, although organizers The governor of Osaka took the relay off public roads last week due to a surge in Covid-19 cases.There are concerns about the fate of the Olympics amid a looming fourth wave of infections in Japan -- especially given that the country has so far only vaccinated about 1.1 million people, which equates to less than one percent of its population."&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;The moms are hoping to shine at the Olympics&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The only difference is that this coach also happens to be her one-year-old daughter, whoHarper-Nelson, a gold medalist at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, undertook sprints and speed drills.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She tells CNN Sport that having her at the track is hilarious, tiresome and wonderful.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether she\'s at the track or in the gym, her daughter is close by.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s funny the things she catches on to.You don\'t realize how much she absorbs everything around her, she\'s playing with her toys that we bring out.At the 2012 Olympics, she won a silver medal and at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, she won a gold medal.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She says that she still loves to compete.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don\'t want my daughter to think that I gave up on her other dreams for me, because I felt my body was still capable."She says that she turned down TV opportunities because she was focused on the Olympics, but now that she has a daughter, it is more on her plate.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would do it all over again as I see her smile and see her little face.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of track and field athletes at this year\'s Games, the most decorated athlete in US track and field history could have company from fellow moms.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With her return to the hurdles,Harper-Nelson explains how she wants to defy the mindset that says "you don\'t have it after you have a child, physically," and "you just need to accept it, moms."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have a good body.She says that they can do it if they choose.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is my life.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is my decision.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead of Tokyo 2020,Harper-Nelson has received sponsorship from &Mother, a US-based nonprofit organization that seeks to break down barriers that prevent women from being both an athlete and a mom.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adaptability is a key component of her training schedule as she is an elite runner as well as a mother of four and a full-time real estate agent.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I block out time for my running, I treat it as any other meeting and I try to block out time," she tells CNN Sport, "but in our real estate market and just the nature of my job."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\'m fortunate that my husband is my coach and he usually makes adjustments on the fly.On a couple of weeks ago, I was supposed to work out at 10 a.m., but I didn\'t get it done until 4:30.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I walk in the door from a race or a workout, no matter how it went, my kids have been able to provide a sense of perspective.If they get to go on a trip, like when I took them to London a couple of years ago for the world champ, that was exciting to them.They don\'t care if I lose or have a bad day.It\'s just back into the normal routine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have learned that it took me longer to get back into shape.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you feel ready for something, but your body isn\'t ready, you need to be patient.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As she took off for her first sprint a month and a half after giving birth to her daughter, she recalls how "loose and fluid" her body felt.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started to cry.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was wondering what this was.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That was really an eye-opener to realize my body is different and I need to be a student of this new body."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was announced last month that no overseas fans would be allowed to attend the Games in Tokyo.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The millions of people watching at home are unlikely to see their children in the stands if they qualify.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sight of a mother competing at the Olympics would surely inspire other women around the world to do the same.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;There is more footage of a jockey posing on a dead horse&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board said on Tuesday that it was aware of further social media content circulating and the matter was under investigation.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group is standing on the gallops.Rob James confirmed in an interview with The Irish Field that he was the man who sat on the horse, and apologized for his actions.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that defending his stupidity at the time would add insult and hurt to the loyal people that have supported him during his career.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am devastated by the damage I have done and will do my best to make up for it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The British Horseracing Authority (BHA) has since temporarily banned Gordon Elliott while the Irish authorities conduct an investigation, after a photo of him sitting on top of a dead horse went viral.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He apologized for the image and said he had received a phone call as he was standing over the horse, waiting to help.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the short term, lifetime bans should be given to professionals found to be abusing racehorses, whether dead or alive.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Animal Aid, 186 horses died as a result of racing in Britain in 2019.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 186 horses that were killed in jump racing.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;GordonElliott apologized over a photo of himself sitting on a dead horse&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;I am profoundly sorry for any offence that this photo has caused, and I can categorically say that this is not the first time that this photo has caused offence.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I appreciate that an initial viewing of the photo suggests it is callous and staged, but nothing could be further from the truth.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is making a peace sign with one hand and holding his phone to his face with the other, and a caption across the photo reads: "New work rider this morning."When the call came in, he sat down without thinking, and then gestured to wait until he was done, according to the statement.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, I feel it is important to provide people with some context surrounding this photo."Elliott ended the statement by saying he was cooperating fully with an investigation announced by the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board."Respect for horses is a fundamental value of our sport, contrary to the impression in this picture, and we hope the Irish authorities will quickly confirm how this shocking picture originated," the spokesman said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IHRB assured us that the investigation will be carried out as quickly as possible and that they will keep us informed as more information becomes available.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With that in mind, we have decided to end our association with Gordon with immediate effect."Elliott is a former jockey who started training horses in 2006, according to his website.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Animal Aid charity, 186 horses died in Britain in the last year because of racing.The charity, which describes itself as one of the UK\'s largest animal rights groups, said 146 of the horses were killed in jump racing.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;The climbers are aiming to boost diversity&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;He was raised in the outskirts of Los Angeles but moved to Montana when he was in college.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He fell in love with the outdoors and the ice climbing opportunities in Montana.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ainuu taught himself how to climb and is now a seasoned professional, on trips across the United States, but he says living in a White area, whilst taking part in a sport with few other Black athletes, weighs heavily on him.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite not recalling any racist incidents, the climber says it is more of a collection of "microaggressions" from both the local and climbing community.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They feel like they have to say something when they see that you are different.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just ignore a lot of stuff because I\'m mellow.It really does weigh down on you if someone says a stupid racist thing.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It all builds up and if a person ignores it, there is still an effect.The sport has seen a boom in recent years, with films such as "Free Solo" making it into the mainstream and climbing gyms on the rise.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the cost of clothing and safety equipment acts as a huge barrier to entry for many and the lack of representation amongst the world\'s top professionals is being recognized more than ever before.Now a member of The North Face\'s elite climbing team, Ainuu wants to change the narrative.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ainuu was so excited to be part of a new documentary film called "Black Ice" which looks at a collaboration with Memphis Rox -- a not-for-profit climbing gym in South Memphis, US.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one is turned away because of their ability to pay.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elena Delavega, Associate Professor at the University of Memphis, tells CNN Sport that South Memphis is one of the places that the organization has opened up the world of climbing to.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The area is under threat from gentrification.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a desire to improve the area and that is a problem for this neighborhood.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poor people living there have no improvements happening.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the 2020 Memphis Poverty fact sheet, the poverty rate for the city is 21.7%, with the percentage higher among minority groups.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning from the experts, the Memphis Rox team spend time scaling frozen waterfalls and skiing in the cold.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was cool.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ainuu laughs and says, "Just having that much melanin in Montana."The official photographer at Memphis Rox who worked on "Black Ice" is acutely aware of the problems presented to young people growing up.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a million traps for you to fall into between trying to live and survive.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s a beautiful place.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like Memphis.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being from where I am, we are able to just get up and go to a whole new environment and tough it out.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\'ve been shot at so this is nothing.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having never considered a career in photography or making films about climbing, Martin now finds himself in love with the sport.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says that climbing gives you the chance to let your guard down and that living in Memphis forces you to grow up fast.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He understands the importance of representation in the sport and says stories need to be told by more Black filmmakers.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a difference, we can act like there isn\'t.When you\'re sitting with people and talking with people and just being able to relate, it\'s different when it\'s based on a documentary.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin has been on multiple trips with Ainuu since filming "Black Ice" and his social media feeds are now full of climbing content.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ainuu noticed a frozen pillar next to the road.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin watched his friend jump out of the car, run across the road and climb without ropes.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From the hood, that would be white folk stuff," Martin says.Martin has fostered a strong relationship since the trip to Montana.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the driving forces behind the film\'s conception was Anker, who has long pushed for better diversity in outdoor activities.Martin and Ainuu say it\'s important to have White allies in the sport.Martin says that there is one thing for you to do.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The death of George Floyd in 2020 was a wake up call for the global climbing community, according to Anker, who acknowledges that not enough has been done in the past to make climbing inclusive.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anker tells CNN Sport that it\'s trying to change the view of climbing.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has always been the domain of the white male to see this as an athletic pursuit.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As big expeditions go forward, there is more inclusivity from both genders.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anker hopes "Black Ice" will encourage people from all walks of life to adopt his love for climbing, which he says can be used as a tool to heal the deep divisions and racial tensions.He says that mountains are revered in all the world\'s great religions.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s a good way for humans to approach other humans.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s a climbing gym, but it\'s also a community center where these people are.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a really meaningful thing.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although climbing is a sport about going up mountains, moreover, it\'s a transformational change in how humans interact with other humans and to foster this, is kind of my life\'s goal."Campbell, one of the experts leading the team in Montana, echoes.Campbell tells CNN Sport that climbing is a reflection of society.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the solution to society\'s issues has to be more than one."Individual climbers have to be supportive of it and work to make the community really inclusive, and I think that\'s something that we try to do on a personal level."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of us are interested in making the sport accessible to everyone.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;The author says we should be less afraid&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;It wasn\'t easy.The US climber had powered on through the dark and dealt with a deep cut to her head to become the first woman to free climb the Golden Gate route in under 24 hours.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She became the fourth woman to free climb the monolith within a day, after completing the mammoth task in 21 hours, 13 minutes and 51 seconds.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was very dark.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stars were gone.I keep telling people that when great sporting achievements happen, a lot of times there is an audience or a stadium, but with climbing, it\'s not so much like that.There was a quiet special moment in this place.It\'s something I\'ll never forget.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, an attempt last year ended in disaster after Harrington fell 50 feet, hit her head on a ledge, and suffered a concussion.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was very serious initially and it turned out that I got really lucky and I did not suffer any long-term injuries.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She\'s spent a lot of time practicing different pitches and sections of a climbing wall to become familiar with the most famous rock in the world of climbing.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alex Honnold climbed El Capitan without a safety rope in the Oscar-winning film Free Solo, which captured the public\'s imagination.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honnold was one of two people who helped Harrington on her successful ascent, the other being Adrian Ballinger, an experienced climber and mountaineer.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honnold helped for the first two thirds of the climb.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rope was attached to the top of the wall and Honnold was at the bottom.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technique is risky because it helps speed up the ascent.Ballinger took over belaying duties near the top where Harrington knew she would have to slow down.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The couple took it pitch by pitch, with Harrington waiting for her partner to catch up before taking on another section.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was the one who supported me while I practiced on the wall, and I knew that it was going to get harder.I needed someone to be with me for that.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she fell 12 hours into the climb, her hands slipped off the ground, she was pushed to her limits.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She admitted that she might have been focused on the upcoming pitch when she saw black and felt blood pouring down her face.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seemed as though the challenge would have to be abandoned again because of the deep gash on her head.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had not suffered a concussion."I just had one of those crazy, out of body, flow state experiences, where you don\'t really even think and you\'re just sort of like that," she said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions of Americans waited to see who their new president would be, but the climb distracted them from what was arguably one of the most important days in US history.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She admits that attempting the feat on election night was semi deliberate and that she had always planned to be ready in early November.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that everyone in this country was feeling a lot of uncertainty and lack of control.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It worked out, I definitely thought about it a lot less than most people.As an only child, her competitive edge began with a healthy rivalry with her cousins.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She remembers the first time she competed against them on a small, local climbing wall.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After signing with the North Face, she became the US sport climbing champion five times and twice winning the North American championship.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She moved to California and began climbing in the park.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said she felt fear quite frequently."I work through it by accepting it and trying to understand why it\'s there and then taking steps to move forward."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s a valid emotion and we shouldn\'t shy away from it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can use it as fuel and strength.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of challenges in Europe that she\'s keen to take on, although not all will be as dangerous as her last.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 90 percent of her climbing is safe and she says more dangerous trips come after a lot of thought.She hasn\'t ruled out a return to the park.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said there were plenty of other routes to challenge her.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;The Atlantic Ocean world record row was enjoyed by Jasmine Harrison&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;It signals a call into action, but with a foggy head and a confused mind.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The constant ringing or buzzing is a sign of bad news.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being woken up at 4 a.m. in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean is a sign of all of the above.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oh my God," Harrison exclaimed on the video recording, "I\'m actually shaking."She was halfway through a daring solo adventure -- rowing across the Atlantic -- when she realized that she was on the verge of total calamity.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 21-year-old told CNN Sport that she had to use her radio, flares, and equipment in that terrifying moment.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then row and steer!&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go do that.Contact technology.You can find out which direction.Bearings!She says, "I really needed to engage my brain when I woke up at half past four in the morning after a long shift of night rowing."Only 18 people have made it across the Atlantic on their own.Harrison describes herself as a normal child, but one with a thirst for adventure.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then he did.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just landed on the deck after being flung out.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second capsizing was less dramatic because she was in her cabin at the time, but her elbow was injured and still bruised upon the completion of her journey.The goal was to row 20,000 strokes a day, the equivalent of 60 miles.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harrison took solace in the wildlife that seemed to be along for the ride when the going was rough.She exclaimed from the quayside in Antigua that it was so cool.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are less than a foot away from the sea all the time.I took a picture of a lot of dolphins and in one picture I had 40 dolphins.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her joy is infectious as she narrates the scene to nobody in particular, because she saw whales, marlin, and had a little crab on her boat.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh my gosh, that was so bad!&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that the fish were aware of her presence.They are aware of it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I put my hand in the water every morning and the pilot fish would swim to my hand.Where will you take me today?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She ponders, "How many times is a human being so far away from another human being?"Harrison says she spent many long hours deep in her own thoughts, realizing that very few people on Earth could ever experience such extreme solitude for so long.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you\'re at home alone, you\'ve got a neighbor sitting a few meters away on the other side of the wall.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 70 days, three hours and 48 minutes, Harrison made it to Antigua and pulled her final strokes into the Guinness Book of World Records.She was faced with more than a dozen interviews after stepping back on dry land.The media interest has been the most surprising since she left the Canary Islands, she says she doesn\'t understand what all the fuss is about.I was doing this because I wanted to do it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the moment, something has happened.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything else was canceled when the Talisker Whiskey Challenge happened.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She doesn\'t have any plans for another adventure, but she already knows that trying to top this experience would ruin it.In time, the magnitude of her accomplishment will sink in, but it will also take time for the bruise to heal and for the ground to steady beneath her feet.Harrison barely slept in her first night back on dry land.It\'s a weird feeling, but wonderful.To feel like you\'re in another world.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;"'When we come together it's powerful,' Henry says"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;He made the decision at the end of March following a series of online racist abuse aimed at Black footballers and the inability of social media companies to hold users accountable for their actions.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\'m talking about the people who have been harassed for the way they look, for what they believe in, for the color of their skin, on social media.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Maybe if I come off social media, taking a stand for the people that don\'t have a voice, maybe you can create a wave because of me coming off social media."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People want to know why.There was a time when I was like, "Well, it\'s kind of a shame that people are not reacting."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His actions have definitely had the desired effect.The English Football League, Women\'s Super League and Women\'s Championship, along with the game\'s governing bodies and organizations such as Kick It Out, will take part in a three-day social media blockade.Henry says you need the strength of the pack if you want to come off social media.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a great tool, but people sometimes use it as a weapon.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I realized that coming of it might create a wave in the media and make people answer questions.When I saw what was happening and what was going to happen at the weekend.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I said, "OK, OK, it\'s a start, it\'s a start, and now they\'re loud about it."It looks like we\'re getting brave into trying to make those big companies answer to the questions that we have, and I know it\'s not easy also on their side, but that\'s your job."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We both want to hold people who share it accountable.We do this by taking action on content and accounts that break our rules and cooperating with law enforcement when we receive a valid legal request.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are determined to make sure the football conversation on our service is safe for fans, players and everyone involved in the game.Everyone has a role to play in the issue of racism.We are committed to doing our part and continue to work closely with valued partners in football, government and police, along with the working group convened by Kick It Out to identify ways to tackle this issue collectively.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henry told CNN that his representatives have been in touch with the social media company.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henry declined the chance to meet with someone at Instagram, as he has always maintained the priority for social media companies is to take action to end the abuse.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just want to do something.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is all.What are we going to talk about?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tell me what you just said?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henry warns against being lulled into a false sense of security, despite the fact that the blackout is a welcome move.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He understands it will be an uphill battle and admits he may never see it come to fruition, but is steadfast in his commitment to the fight.It\'s a start.We can make people aware of our disapproval and hope that things will change.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you try to do something, you are making people aware, and along the way you will have an impact.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Maybe not this year, maybe not in two years, maybe not in three years."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe we won\'t see it, but you have to do something.&lt;p&gt;

0,5,&lt;p&gt;"Rodgers doesn't want to return to the Packers"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Rodgers has told some inside the organization he wants to leave.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the report, Packers president Mark Murphy, general manager Brian Gutekunst and head coach Matt LaFleur have all traveled to visit Rodgers.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Packers do not want to trade Rodgers, the report said.Rodgers has been a vital part of our success and we look forward to competing for another championship with him leading our team.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rodgers had a two-week stint as the host of "Jeopardy!" and has publicly expressed his desire to become the full-time host of the show while still playing football.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Packers selected quarterback Jordan Love in the first round of the 2020 NFL draft.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;In the semifinals against Manchester City, it collapsed completely&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Captain Marquinhos had headed the French champion ahead in a dominant first half on Wednesday but the hosts eventually lost the first leg 2-1 after capitulating in the second half.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;City, who were poor in the opening period, wrestled the tie back through Kevin De Bruyne\'s fortunate goal and a free-kick from Riyad Mahrez that somehow slithered through the wall.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 77th minute, Gueye was sent off for a reckless lunge on Gundogan.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pundit on beIN SPORTS said that in the second half, Paris Saint-Germain were protective and not progressive.Is it because they weren\'t physically capable?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They became emotional and aggressive in a stupid way.City is flying domestically and looks certain to win the title in the coming weeks, while Paris Saint-Germain are facing strong competition in the title race.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result of the team losing eight games in the league is that they mentally collapsed when it was 1-1.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has an impact because the team knows they have lost many games.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s not like the season before, when they were unbeatable in the league.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The counterattack was snuffed out by City\'s quality on and off the ball.There were two different halves.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We did well in the first half."We created chances and deserved the lead, but in the second half they were better than us."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both sides will be aware the tie is far from over ahead of the return leg in Manchester on May 4.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The French side will need the likes of Neymar and Kylian Mbappe to improve on their performances, with both attackers very quiet for much of the match.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the best attackers in the world, Kylian Mbappe, failed to record a single shot on target in the entire game.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;There was a 97 mph pitch to face&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"The left-handed Genesis Cabrera hit him in the face with a 97 mph pitch.Even though he was bleeding,Harper left the field under his own power.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All that kind of stuff came back good.The face is still there.We are all good.Cabrera hit Didi in the back with his next pitch, making it two hit batters on the first two hitters he faced.The umpires warned both teams, which prompted the manager to be ejected.Harper, 28, went 0-for-2 before leaving, leaving his season batting average at.321.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;The Utah Jazz set a new franchise record&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The previous record of 153 had stood since 1978 but 24 points from Bojan Bogdanovic and a further 23 from Jordan Clarkson off the bench helped break it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 49-point win was the largest in franchise history.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah stays first in the Western Conference despite the historic win by the Jazz.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said after the game that he had never seen a 150 on the board before.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We wanted to make a point.The Utah Jazz lost to the Minnesota Timberwolves in their last two games, but head coach Quin Snyder said his side had shown good potential.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought we played well the other night, but I\'m probably in the minority.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said after the match that they didn\'t shoot it well.We were solid tonight.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Phoenix Suns secured their first playoff berth since 2010 with a win over the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday.Everybody was like, "Oh, the Suns are down" when I first arrived.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They haven\'t made the playoffs in a long time.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s a blessing and I don\'t take it for granted, I was so close last year.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;"The golfer who admits it's odd to think she's a major winner"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;She told CNN Sport\'s Don Riddell that she gets the recognition and attention.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Mission Hills Country Club in Rancho Mirage, California, Tavatanakit held her nerve to win by two shots, despite a surging Lydia Ko behind her.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s been weird coming to terms with the fact that she\'s actually won a major, with well-wishers reaching out to her in the aftermath of her victory.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It still doesn\'t seem right to me to think that I\'m actually a major champion.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\'ve dreamed of that moment for a long time, but to actually have that under my belt is still weird.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn\'t expect this to happen in my first year, but it did.She said that she grew up watching Ariya and Moriya play.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She moved to California to play on the golf team of the UCLA Bruins and felt honored to be recognized as one of the people who would make the game of golf in Thailand grow.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She earned Galle Truet the Galle Truet Freshman of the Year award after winning three times in eight tournaments on the Symetra Tour.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had a choice at the end of the year, she could stay in the US and work on her game, or she could go back to Thailand and spend time with her parents.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s a lot for a young woman to do that.She felt like she owed it to her career to do that.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hard work that we did during the off season paid off, with Tavatanakit winning her first major victory at the ANA and finishing fifth in the opening event of the season.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She led throughout the final day, but it wasn\'t easy.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A course-record equaling 62 from New Zealand\'s Ko certainly tested Tavatanakit.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After holing the final putt at the ANA Inspiration and completing the famous jump into Poppie\'s Pond that all victors make, Tavatanakit\'s primary emotion was one of relief.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of self-control, a lot of self-awareness, which is a whole mental grind out there, it was just like a relief feeling where: "Oh my God, I held this thing for so long and a lot of self-control, a lot of self-awareness "When it all happened and it was just a big relief, like someone just pulled out a 100 pound dumbbell off my chest, it\'s that feeling is so light."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She says that she feels the free spirits running inside her system more than when she was in Thailand.It kind of meant being who I am and not afraid to express my feelings, my opinions, and just be kind.You don\'t have to say certain things to fit into society or to get people to accept you.The world No. 13 is the third longest driver on the LPGA Tour, with an average driving distance of 283.786 yards, prompting comparisons between her and the big hitting Bryson DeChambeau, who is arguably revolutionizing men\'s golf.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You just be yourself and keep working hard, keep dreaming, and just be inspired by all your dreams."Tavatanakit now has her sights on winning a golf grand slam -- winning all five majors at the same time.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk about a dream.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;The Black female athlete who disobeyed the US National Anthem has been largely forgotten&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Eroseanna "Rose" Robinson, a track and field star, was consumed by the need to challenge injustice, but her courage has been largely overlooked in the pages of history.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robinson excelled at Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) track events in the 1940s before developing into a leading high jumper, winning at the National AAU Championships in 1958 and joining the US Track and Field team thereafter.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, I don\'t want to be used as a political pawn.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She was critical of the government, the treatment of people by the government, but also foreign policy under the Cold War and the United States kind of trying to clean up its image."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robinson refused to pay her taxes due to her opposition to American foreign policy.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was sentenced to a year and a day in jail, but she still wanted to protest.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She\'s talking about how she\'s mentally getting through the hunger strike by using the same thing that she uses if she\'s training.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge is saying that she stages the strike because she keeps doubling down on her refusal.To draw attention to how unjust this is, I\'m not going to eat.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robinson joined a group called the Peacemakers to oppose segregation and armed conflicts.Robinson\'s place in history as the first athlete to not stand for the US national anthem has been largely forgotten because of her continued activism.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They and their activist contributions have been diminished if not completely dismissed, ignored, and forgotten by the sports media and even many sports historians.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the boycott fell through and everybody ended up in Mexico City, there was a collective decision made that everybody was involved in.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Black women athletes, if they are going to reach a level of notoriety, it\'s conditioned so much on the performance of being respectable and demure.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;"Sen McCabe is the world football's first Climate Justice Officer"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Not about Bohemian FC\'s next opponents, nor those who lie in wait in the weeks and months ahead, it\'s a greater, invisible opponent -- one that is discernibly shaping the present and threatens to leave an indelible mark on the future.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The opponent is the climate emergency.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can\'t trick the laws of nature.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no vaccine for the climate crisis, according to the Irishman, who is a member of a local club.The Climate Justice Officer is the first position of its kind in world football and is voluntary.There were unions and churches at one point but now I think football clubs are one of the only things that someone feels a part of.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that it was a sure sign that they were moving into the spheres where the conversations weren\'t happening.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a very unique opportunity.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not daunting to me.The crisis itself is much more daunting than the scope for change.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can differentiate between what\'s real, what matters and something shiny."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s genuinely about getting into the community and making change that people respond to.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environmental considerations are at the heart of all commercial conversations, and with over 100 European clubs signed up to the European Football for Development Network, whose principle is based on clubs being "committed to their communities and social responsibilities," Football clubs need to mobilize their social media to help their fans because at the end of the day, they draw their legitimacy from their fans.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s about helping your fans move through this very serious transition that we have to move through and creating platforms for them to explain to decision makers the realities of their lives.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;Maya overcame a life-threatening accident to surf two record-breaking waves&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The first question is, "Why the hell did you put yourself here?""Where is my mom?" was the second question.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To onlookers from the shore, Gabeira is a small figure against a large mass of water.She hurtles across the ocean at a terrifying speed while the wave thunders to the surface behind her.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It had a particularly loud, loud noise when it broke behind me, the loudest I\'ve had a wave break close to me.It was 73.5 feet, or 22.4 meters, higher than her previous record.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statistics and footage don\'t tell the whole story.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After three spine surgeries and nearly five years of rehabilitation, Gabeira almost drowned at Praia do Norte, the site of both her records.The biggest wave she had ever surfed caused the accident when she came off.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carlos Burle, her jet ski rider, was able to help her to the beach after she broke her ankle and became unconscious in the swirling waters.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had a lot of doctors telling me to stop because of the difficulties they had dealing with my spine and the uncertainty that continuing the sport at a high level would have on my future health."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her resilience is shown by the fact that she has been able to return to big- wave surfing.She moved to Nazaré, a fishing village north of Lisbon, to hone her craft after the accident.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It showed me how much I didn\'t have everything under control and organized, and how much more I had to improve, even though I got two world records after it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was hooked on water sports after coming from a family with no water sports experience.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She thought from the beginning that surfing was addictive.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wave was always different because the ocean was always different.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It didn\'t feel like you had it.I admired the guys and the boys that would be out there on big days, and I thought that was something I wanted to see portrayed in women more.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that drove me.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There had to be a woman doing that.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to be that person when I was young.The sport still takes her around the world, but she calls Nazaré her home.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surfers from all over the world descend on Nazaré when big waves are predicted.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The record for the largest wave ever surfed by a Brazilian was set by Rodrigo Koxa, while the record for the largest wave ever surfed by an American was set by Garrett McNamara."It\'s very hard when you\'re expecting a very special day, a lot of nerves pile up and you can really feel this crazy energy that it creates."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You feel the energy and everyone\'s organizing and looking at the maps and there\'s all this gossip about the biggest ever."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amount of energy coming towards me makes me nervous, so I have to work on myself to deal with it.They are essential ingredients of big- wave surfing, a discipline that can involve long, uncertain waits until massive swells occur.The fear factor is what it has.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don\'t have to push all those different things if it doesn\'t happen.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel like I used to be a lot like that before my accident, I would compensate all the areas that didn\'t click on the day, and I learned my lessons.Ahead of her most recent world record, for instance, she says she felt calm and grounded starting the day in her own home: "Waking up from my own bed, with my dogs and eating the same thing and having that luxury of feeling like I was at home doing what I do There was a lengthy delay before the record was confirmed.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was able to get the World Surf League and Guinness World Records to establish a women\'s category for the largest wave surfed by launching an online petition.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During her visit to the WSL headquarters in Los Angeles, she was promised support for a women\'s category.She started to think that her efforts would be in vain because of the unanswered emails.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She thought it would be hard to come back and surf the wave.It was difficult to make it a priority for the WSL and the Guinness Book to establish the women\'s category.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was me.It felt at times personal, it felt humiliating, and it felt all kinds of ways, especially coming from a near drown...&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the process, I realized that it was a change.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a result, judging had to span the entire history of the sport, evaluating all potential world record rides up until that point."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measuring the world\'s biggest waves is a complicated process.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts used real-world coordinates, her height, and the length of the Brazilian surfer\'s board to calculate the wave\'s size after reviewing footage of the ride.The whole process was terrible and I had the idea of doing a petition and pressuring them publicly, which worked very well.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a bit nerve-wracking for me to expose myself in that way and to put myself out there, but it worked.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She says she\'s always going to be challenged by that double standard.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still want to be in the water and I still want to see those giant waves despite being scared.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;"He was convicted for a crime he didn't commit and now he's selling art to the Obamas"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;A drawing of the 12th hole at Augusta National Golf Course did.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York native was sentenced in 1992 for the fatal shooting of a man in Buffalo.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, his drawings of well-known golf course holes, which he\'d never seen before in person, saved him from serving his full sentence.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His rendition of Augusta\'s distinctive 12th hole sparked an idea in Dixon, whose appeals had been denied in all courts."I realized at some point that you may have to become one of the greatest artists to ever walk this earth in order to get acknowledgement on what happened to you on this wrongful conviction," he said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the help of a professor at Georgetown University, Marty Tankleff, and his law students,Dixon reclaimed his freedom 27 years after his wrongful conviction.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The artist\'s freedom project, which he hopes will draw the bigger focus and stop anyone from going through what he did, has attracted the attention of some of the biggest names in the world.The fight is against wrongful convictions and sentencing reform.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn\'t have time to be overwhelmed.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have to go to work now, we have to turn adversity into a movement to help others."He says he found an escape in art.He was introduced to a performing arts high school after his teacher noticed his talent and helped him develop it with a pencil.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On one fateful evening in 1991, his life changed.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While he was in Buffalo, a fight broke out in the crowd and someone started shooting.Although one of his friends returned fire, he ran to his car and drove away.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was pulled over by police and asked if he was at the scene of the crime.After admitting that he was, he was taken into custody and charged with murder and shooting at three other people.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His clothes and car were seized.If he fired a weapon, authorities would find gunpowder on his clothing.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He pled guilty in June 1991 to two drive-by shootings and was out on bail at the time of his arrest.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the two days after his arrest, eight people came forward to say that they didn\'t know anything about the crime.Lamarr Scott was kicked out of the police station after he confessed to the crime.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although police ignored the confession and witness statements, they did not ignore the fact that the test results on his clothes and car would come back negative.The police never produced the results of those tests.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, he appeared in court."The court had to assign me a public defender and the public defender had in his possession the confession, the videotaped confession of Lamar Scott, the eight eyewitnesses\' statements, and one of the victims that survived, critically wounded victim, who told them from his hospital bed that I didn\' None of the witnesses made it to court.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My attorney didn\'t call a single witness.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did not give an opening statement to the jury.All of this evidence existed before the trial started, and I was worried about my mom because she was so distraught.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that he told her everything was going to be okay.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wasn\'t worried about myself.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn\'t feel like I was going to get justice at that time.When you\'re innocent of a crime and the evidence is there, eventually justice has to prevail, and this is the mind state that I had at the time.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says he had fallen out of love with drawing and spent his days just trying to survive.In his eighth year in prison, his uncle sent his nephew some colored pencils and paper to remind him of his talents.You may have to leave the prison.He rediscovered his love of art over time.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\'m from the inner city.I\'ve never been on a golf course.I don\'t know anything about it, but bring a picture in and I\'ll draw it for you.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He would take pictures of holes in magazines.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He began to create golf courses and holes from his imagination.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Max Adler, a journalist for Golf Digest magazine, wrote an article every month titled "Golf saved my life" after he caught the attention of him.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The column featured stories about how golf helped people overcome obstacles they were dealing with and what specifically golf did to make them feel better, so Dixon wrote to Adler, hoping the journalist would feature a story on his life.Adler wrote a three-page story in 2012 about the plight of the artist.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his words, "It kind of took off from there."He knew he wasn\'t long for prison when he found out that others outside his cell were interested in his life.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know what?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this is it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He remembers thinking, "I\'m going home now."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The law students and Tankleff were discussing the case on the phone.The district attorney involved in the case was interviewed by the students as part of a documentary on his story.They asked him about the clothes in his car.You tested these items.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was free after 27 years after his wrongful conviction, because he was entitled to a new trial because of a Brady violation.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He started a prison reform foundation called the Art of Freedom, which campaigns against wrongful convictions and for sentencing reform.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although he admits that he\'s not a golf fan at all, he was invited to the Masters Tournament and met 18-time major winner Jack Nicklaus, who told the artist that he reminded him of Nelson Mandela because of his "spirit."I had a one-on-one chat with Tiger.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I said, "Hey Tiger, you\'re going to win the Masters."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He looked at me and said, "I\'m going to try my best."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When her office reached out to inquire about a Christmas gift for her husband Barack, who is a keen golfer, she initially wasn\'t sure if it was a hoax.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subject of his first-ever golf drawing, the 12th hole at Augusta, was the perfect present for the former US president because he realized the request was genuine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barack Obama posted a photo on social media celebrating the present from his wife with a caption explaining the gift and her story.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s an incredible piece, but the story behind it is even better.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He received a personal video from Obama in which he thanked the artist and said he was proud of him.It\'s the crowning moment of Dixon\'s remarkable story, and one which caps his extraordinary journey from being jailed for a crime he didn\'t commit to being freed, and becoming a renowned golf artist.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;Michael Visacki shared a phone call with his dad after his PGA Tour dream came true&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The American fell into the arms of his caddie and burst into tears after sinking his final putt at the Valspar Championship before calling his dad to tell him the good news.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The heart-warming moment of Visacki crying on the phone to his father has gone viral and shows just how hard he has had to work.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visacki told his father that he made it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been a long road for Visacki to get to this point.He has traveled over a hundred thousand miles in his Honda Accord.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He turned pro after a promising career as a junior.He missed out on his first cut of the year after his ball got stuck in a tree.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says that moment nearly crushed him, but with the support of his parents, he was able to keep fighting.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just a lot of people give up on their dreams, probably because they can\'t afford it," said Visacki, who has worked multiple jobs and lived with his parents to fund his dream.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said in an emotional press conference that he never considered quitting.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never thought about quitting because I know I have the game to compete out here.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week\'s Valspar Championship is being played in Florida, US, and has a prize fund of $ 6.9 million.&lt;p&gt;

0,5,&lt;p&gt;US owners have a checkered history of investing in English soccer&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The US owners have little or no understanding of why English soccer fans care so passionately about the clubs they support, according to a former Manchester United chief executive.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manchester United\'s owners don\'t know what football is all about, according to the club\'s CEO.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\'m not sure what the people in that club know about the club.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunday\'s postponement of the game between Manchester United andLiverpool due to fan protests -- that at times turned ugly -- brought into sharp focus the discontent of many supporters over the way the Glazer family have run the premier league\'s most successful team.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police estimate over 1,000 protesters invaded the pitch at United\'s Old Manchester stadium.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of 200 people gathered outside The Lowry Hotel, where the United players were staying, to protest against the club\'s US owners.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The club has no desire to see peaceful protestors punished, but will work with the police to identify those involved in criminal activity, and will also issue its own sanctions to any season ticket holder or member identified.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are committed to dialogue and engagement with our fans through appropriate channels.Six of England\'s top clubs signed up last month to join the European Super League, a competition consisting of 12 of the biggest teams in European football.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the venture fell apart less than 48 hours after it was first announced, the lack of fan consultation galvanized many supporters -- not just at United -- who are intent on wresting back some semblance of control they pay good money to watch.Fans are charged up to $132 to attend a game.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strength of feeling and the right of fans to know what is happening were acknowledged by the Premier League in a statement on Monday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are committed to maintaining close dialogue with supporters and their representatives, as we work with The FA and Government to identify solutions, but ask that all protests are peaceful," the statement said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNN reached out to the Glazer family, as well as Henry and Kroenke.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Manchester United Supporters Trust (MUST), a group of more than 200,000 club supporters, said in a statement on Monday that not one member of the Glazer family has ever had so much as a conversation with them.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fans who spoke to CNN were worried that the club would be saddled with debt and that the family would only care about its brand and revenues.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the Glazers bought the team, Manchester United was debt-free.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The net debt of the club is over half a billion dollars according to the club\'s latest accounts.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The club had a net debt of $283.16 million in December of 2019.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The net investment of $240.3 million in player acquisitions over the past two years is more than any other major European club.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over a billion dollars has been spent since the beginning of the year.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, MUST organized a protest in which fans wore green and gold scarves to games, the club\'s original colors.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MUST demanded a response from the Glazers by Friday, after it outlined a four-point plan to "rebalance the current ownership structure in the favour of supporters" in a Monday statement.The plan called for fans to have the same voting rights as the Glazer family.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the points is that fans of Manchester United can buy shares in the club until they are reduced to a minority or being bought out altogether.That type of model is a nod to the 50+1 ownership rule prevalent in German football, where external investors and commercial partners are not allowed to gain control, instead ensuring members, often also fans, retain majority ownership of clubs.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weekends ago, protests took place outside of the club\'s stadium in London, demanding that owner Stan Kroenke sell his shares.Daniel Ek, a fan of the club, said he would submit a bid, but there was no intention of selling the club.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news that the club had signed up for the ESL wasn\'t well received, as evidenced by a video posted on the club\'s social media.Over the last 48 hours, you were clear that it wouldn\'t work.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We heard you.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I heard you.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henry apologized to the players and to the people who work so hard to make the fans proud.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have no responsibility for this disruption.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were the most disrupted.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This hurts the most.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They work hard to make you proud.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know that the entire team has the expertise, leadership and passion necessary to rebuild trust and help us move forward.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current owners have run into trouble by looking at club ownership like owning any other business, says Joseph DaGrosa, a US investor and chairman of the Kapital Football Group.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some fans would like to see different owners at their clubs, while others would like to see the model used in Germany implemented in the UK.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legislation to alter the fabric of football ownership laws is not certain to be implemented by the UK government.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last few weeks have shown that the genie is out of the bottle and fans want to see English clubs listen to them.&lt;p&gt;

0,5,&lt;p&gt;Supporters unite in anger as they protest against the Super League&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Supporters of English clubs due to join the European Super League have stepped up their opposition to the controversial project.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With similar feelings echoed by fan groups across England\'s so-called "Rich Six" clubs it is perhaps no surprise that two, Manchester City and Chelsea, are believed to be harbouring second thoughts about changing to the new competition.The statement said that members and football supporters across the world had experienced the ultimate betrayal.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a decision of greed to line the pockets of those at the top and it has been made with no consideration for the loyal supporters, our history, our future or the future of football in this country.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is unforgivable.The trust is thinking along parallel lines.The death of everything football should be about, it said in a statement.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will do everything we can to keep this from happening.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plans were summed up by club officials removing protest banners from the precinct.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are appalled and oppose this decision.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TheFenway Sports Group ignores fans in their pursuit of money.Football is ours.Spion Kop 1906 will be withdrawing their flags which have adorned the Kop in the absence of fans because of the swine flu, in a symbolic gesture certain to be picked up by match-day television cameras.Spion Kop 1906 said that they and other groups would be removing their flags.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Manchester United Supporters Trust said that a closed shop of self selected wealthy clubs goes against everything football.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone involved in the proposal, including Manchester United, should immediately withdraw.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said that Enic, the temporary custodians of the club, should distance themselves from any rebel group.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before making decisions that will fundamentally change the course of history for Spurs, it is important to consider the implications fully.&lt;p&gt;

0,5,&lt;p&gt;Eddie Jones is under scrutiny by external rugby experts&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Eddie Jones has escaped the sack as England\'s head coach but is set to be placed under greater scrutiny by a team of hand-picked, expert consultants, with the Rugby Football Union stopping short of backing him through to the 2023 World Cup.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They will be called upon to review and support the coaching strategy after every England campaign, though have not been named by the RFU, which has also kept secret the identity of the review panel, who were assisted by coaches past and present, and a series of presentations from Jones.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement between the RFU and the Premiership clubs which meant Jones had a fixed 28-man player pool to select from was highlighted.In addition, England\'s indiscipline at the breakdown was identified as a problem.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones pointedly made reference to returning to a "winning performance" in next year\'s tournament, with the RFU refusing to comment over what action it may take if England finish fifth again.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweeney said that they were all disappointed to finish fifth in the Six Nations.Our track record and results under Eddie meant that we, the players and our fans had higher expectations.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every campaign debrief helps us to learn and improve because sport is all about fine margins.Eddie used self-awareness and humility to allow us to look at every aspect of the tournament to identify every small change we can make in order to improve.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last point is significant because Jones has repeatedly told of how he gives short shrift to players in their domestic form and has fallen out with clubs in the past, most notably when describing the Bath owner Bruce Craig as "the Donald Trump of rugby".During the Six Nations we were not up to our usual high standards, so we are introducing an annual summer conference featuring the elite England set-up.The team learned a lot from the experience and we have identified actions to move the team forward.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;There are two teams on a road to the summer final&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"Without the help of Covid-19 this season would have been different.The domestic campaign in England was held at the end of June, while the inaugural Rainbow Cup involves a leap into the unknown.Even though people talk about the benefits of summer rugby, it is already here, with barely any rain in the forecast for the immediate future.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six of last year's top seven are renewing their season tickets, the exception being London Irish at Wasps.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that last season's final didn't take place until October may not have been a surprise, but the leading three did not have to worry about Europe.The club currently occupying fourth spot is playing with as much freedom as anyone.The continuous three-minute spell in the Sale v Gloucester game on Saturday made for a brakes-off, freewheeling run-in.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to retain a modicum of defensive shape and close-quarters control is going to be required as the pace increases.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quins have scored three more tries than Bristol so far this season but, perhaps more tellingly, they have conceded 20 more as well.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The side finishing second in the regular season has won the trophy 11 times, more than any other side, debunking the rule that the champion must come from the top two.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the table hints at a final, so does recent history.For the first time in these parts, the days will be shorter by the time the final takes place on 26 June.Home knockout advantage is not what it used to be if some spectators come back by the semi-finals.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally that side would be Exeter, whose success has been built on a military work ethic and superior fitness that was so instrumental in the closing stages of their big European knockout games last season.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At times this winter, though, the defending champion have found it difficult to summon up the relentless.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lack of a pre-season did not help and some of their key forwards have racked up miles.Sam is set to start his 28th high-intensity game on Friday.Bristol have only lost once in the league since the start of the season, and they beat Exeter 20-7 at Sandy Park in January.They are so spoiled for choice that even the most in-form English player in the land is not certain to start at 15.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They will re-emerge even stronger next season, as will Northampton and a bunch of other mid-table dwellers, but it is Quins who currently look best placed to finish third and book a possible semi-final with the Chiefs at Sandy Park.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lineout of the Chiefs will need to improve if they are to retain the title, as well as the finishing ability of a man who used to work in a pasty shop.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cup?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how many games the South African provinces manage, stick a few rand on Leinster.Don't be surprised if you find yourself thinking about rugby on midsummer's night.This is an extract from the rugby union email.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;"Man City's Super League plan is not sport if you can't lose"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Manchester City\'s manager stated "it is not a sport" if teams are guaranteed to play in the European Super League.The format of a 20-club league of which 15 are planned to be the same every year is fiercely critical of by City, who are one of 12 founding members.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no relation between the effort and the success in a sport.When it doesn\'t matter where you lose, it\'s not a sport.Success is already guaranteed for a few teams when one team fight, fight, fight, arrive at the top and cannot qualify.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is just a statement because the embryo is not yet breathing.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is the reality.We are going to play Paris Saint-Germain next week and we are going to try to reach the final and next season we are going to play it again because we deserve it.People have a duty to clarify as soon as possible, they have an obligation to do so.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why will they not be in the Champions Leagues when they have four?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They need to clarify.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A strongly worded statement was issued by the league after the 14 English top-flight clubs not involved in the Super League met Premier League and Football Association representatives on Tuesday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 14 clubs at the meeting unanimously rejected the plans for the competition.The League is considering all options to prevent it from progressing, as well as holding those shareholders involved to account.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;The executive says that there are doubts about the Super League&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"The two clubs are wavering about joining the European Super League according to an executive at another club.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The others joined because they believe they will be better off if it goes ahead, or they reluctantly joined because they were afraid of missing out.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source from an organisation opposed to the Super League said that while he hoped some clubs would reconsider, he had no direct evidence that they would.The Super League is a closed shop, which is a break away from the current institutions.From the associations, from the leagues.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Uefa congress, Infantino said that Fifa fully supported Uefa and the leagues.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The magic of football, the bond from the lowest leagues of amateur football to the very top of the sport that had sustained for decades, risked being lost if the Super League went ahead.People need to think carefully.They need to reflect and take responsibility.They need to think about all the fans who have contributed to create what European football is today, and what European football clubs are today.It goes back more than 100 years.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;There are truths about race and politics in Playing Away&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Most club players will be aware of the situation.Three of your players are missing, including the captain, who was last seen being thrown out of a pub and wandering around a graveyard with a bottle of Scotch.There is a hint that your opening bowler is stoned in the film Playing Away.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its 1986 release was given a 15 certificate for a couple of uses of the F-word, since the rest is less raunchy than an episode of Midsomer Murders, and that cannot have helped its reach.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You tend to meet more cricket lovers who claim to have watched all three hours 45 minutes of Lagaan than have even heard of this British film, which came out around the same time as My Beautiful Laundrette, with similar backing from Channel Four.This paper ignored Ové\'s work with its claim that The Final Test was "Britain\'s only significant cricket picture".It has not gone anywhere and is still relevant.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matthews is an expatriate who has not considered the tactlessness of inviting a Caribbean team to Sneddington as part of the village\'s "Third World Week".&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The captain of Sneddington does not command the respect or goodwill of his teammates.The visitors are suffering from their own internal divisions, and Willie Boy is at odds with his daughter over whether they should return to Jamaica.The script was written by CarylPhillips when he was in his 20s and, funny as it is, almost every scene crackles with some kind of politics, be they of class, race or sex.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1975, Ové was the first black British filmmaker to direct, and he has a long history of encouraging and enabling black creatives.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trinidadian British brothers in west London who join the Black Power movement were banned for two years.In recent years, Ové\'s work has begun to receive wider recognition that it has always deserved.A show called Get Up, Stand Up Now was put on by Zak, an artist, and was built around Ové\'s archive.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ové uses cricket to reflect the complex power struggles and communication failures of humans from all different environments.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was important to Horace that black filmmakers don\'t get caught in the trap of only making films about their own kind.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the director Gurinder Chadha was asked which filmmakers she considered most under appreciated, she named Ové and referenced Playing Away.She said that it was a tragedy that it wasn\'t given a wider release.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can watch it right now.The Guardian has a weekly cricket email called The Spin.You can subscribe by visiting this page and following the instructions.&lt;p&gt;

0,5,&lt;p&gt;De la Sayette was suspended over a cocaine test&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The career of Benot de la Sayette, who took the Lincoln Handicap on his first professional ride on turf last month, came to an abrupt halt on Tuesday morning when it was revealed that the 18-year-old has tested positive for cocaine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rider denied the allegation, saying the video was taken in October.He was supported by the Professional Jockeys\' Association, which issued a statement on his behalf stating he "did not and does not take cocaine".He maintains that he did not take cocaine on that occasion and did not do so after winning the Lincoln.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has made mistakes but the PJA will continue to support him.The assistant to Appleby said that the horse was still learning and was nearly two lengths further back in third.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;William Buick, his jockey, said he was learning on the job and needed racing to keep improving.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was entitled to be green wherever he went, but he handled the track well for his first time on it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a possibility of the Lingfield Derby Trial on 8 May, as well as the Oaks without another run.She does everything you want at home.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I loved the way she was able to navigate around the side and deal with the bends.Technique is 25-1 for the Oaks in a market headed by Santa Barbara at 7-2.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Santa Barbara, a daughter of the 2012 Derby winner, is a strong favourite for the 1,000 Guineas, despite having only raced once in her career when successful in a maiden event over a mile at the Curragh in September.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;Alex Smith refused to allow the NFL to destroy him&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Alex Smith, a three-time Pro Bowl quarterback who returned to the field after a gruesome leg break, will be the reason why the Comeback Player of the Year award should be renamed after him.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the most imaginative Hollywood screenwriter couldn\'t have imagined that Smith would retire after 16 NFL seasons.Smith talked about perseverance and wanting to be able to take walks with his wife and how he will now school his kids in the backyard in his retirement announcement.Football wouldn\'t let me give up, that line seemed a bit off.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Football is designed to make weaker men give up.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hard work.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doubters.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ache.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith was the one who never let football destroy him.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith was drafted by the 49ers as the first overall pick in 2005, ahead of Bay Area native Rodgers.His football life almost ended in its infancy when, in 2007, then 49ers head Mike Nolan questioned his quarterback\'s toughness to the locker room, one of football\'s most egregious sins.The narrative was odd.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nolan lost his job the next season after Smith played while his arm was almost immobile.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith had surgery and was going to be resurrected in San Francisco.A confirmed break in his shoulder ended his 2008 season before it began.Smith was knocked down, but not out.Smith resumed his topsy turvy career in 2009.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith did not lose the starter job again, this time to Troy Smith, before becoming a free agent with a cloudy future.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tim Couch, Mitchell Trubisky, JaMarcus Russell and Ryan Leaf.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highly ranked quarterbacks who don\'t perform after four or five years are almost always labeled as busts.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They fail under pressure, expectations, and early failures.It is impossible to reverse a downward trajectory.Unless you are Alex Smith.Smith was signed to a cheap one-year deal by the 49ers in 2011.Smith\'s brand of the West Coast offense was thought to succeed by Harbaugh.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith would need to beat Drew Brees in his prime to win.He did that by leading two exciting touchdown drives of 80 and 85 yards, which were capped by a 28-yard touchdown run by Smith, and the famous Vernon Davis reception, which sealed the win.The Alex Smith Story could have ended that day.The 49ers could have committed to their quarterback who could have handed the reins to Colin Kaepernick a few years down the road.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith had an efficient start to the year, leading the league in completion percentage, before a concussion ended his career in San Francisco.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unheralded second-round pick, Kaepernick replaced Smith and in just one high-profile game, displayed such a dazzling combination of arm strength and electric running, that a permanent QB change was obvious.Smith never had a chance despite the week-by-week narrative from Harbaugh.Kap was the guy.Smith left San Francisco beloved by the franchise and its fans, a deep fondness that remains strong today, despite being honest about being disappointed yet also supportive of the organization.Smith left San Francisco beloved by the franchise and its fans, a deep fondness that remains strong today, despite being honest about being He left Kansas City a three-time Pro Bowler and beloved by Patrick Mahomes, who has praised Smith for his mentorship.With the injury Smith had, he was able to lead his team to the playoffs.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His life and leg were saved.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But his playing career?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith\'s return to action in October 2020, almost two years after the injury, still feels like a dream.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A man with a metal knee brace couldn\'t walk without it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Smith to endure real game action was a miracle.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is time to believe in football gods for Smith to work his way back to a starter role and lead Washington to the playoffs.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith said in February that he threw a wrench in the team\'s plan when he decided to come back.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith\'s entire career was defined by driving over the holes in the ground.He walks away as a hero because of the way he handled himself in the sport he played.Some of the most popular fade from our memories are when players come and go from the NFL.Smith\'s journey will be remembered forever.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;"Women's wheelchair basketball makes a move"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The world\'s first women\'s wheelchair basketball league and the first professional para-sport league in the UK will be headed by British Wheelchair Basketball.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The players will be able to choose their next base from the packages offered by each university.The league will comprise 60 British players and 40% internationals, promoting the growth of the women\'s game while potentially attracting some of the best female players in the world.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was always something we wished we could do and now it has happened in two years, it is amazing.It is an appropriate step forward during a period where Great Britain has risen to be among the world\'s best across the sport, with the women\'s team winning silver at both the world championship and the European championship.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fans will be able to watch and support their teams in the arenas.The league wants to raise the profile of wheelchair basketball and create visibility in the media.Outside of internationals, women\'s wheelchair basketball players often play in teams alongside men, meaning they don\'t play in the dominant roles they would command in a women\'s team.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitzpatrick believes the league will transform the identity of their sport, because it doesn\'t exist anywhere else in the world.She said that they are not going to be seen as disabled athletes anymore.We are going to be broadcasted on and spoken about as athletes, not as people that you see every four years.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, Amy Conroy recalled the early days of her disability after her leg was removed during cancer treatment as a child.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to be normal.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would like to hide it.She said she wanted to blend in with everyone else.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being around people with disabilities made me think, "Actually, no, I\'m going to embrace it."This is awesome.There is so much good that is going to come from the premier league.She used to train by herself in a sports hall with the lights off because it was cheaper, at school during mornings, breaks and lunch, or on outdoor courts with her father.&lt;p&gt;

0,5,&lt;p&gt;Everton condemns the big six for the Super League split&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The six Premier League clubs pushing to join the European Super League have been condemned byEverton.The owner of the club said that every facet of the proposal was against the idea of British football.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Football clubs belong to fans and their communities.Much of their romance is taken away by this.Football is no longer a game because it is a money game.The fourth most successful club in English league football with nine league championships are not involved in the controversial break up and are expected to argue for the strongest possible sanctions against the self-destructive clubs.Six clubs are acting in their own interests.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This preposterous arrogance is not wanted anywhere in football outside of the clubs that have drafted this plan.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have a responsibility that should be taken seriously.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want them to think about what they want their legacy to be.&lt;p&gt;

0,5,&lt;p&gt;There is a document justifying the break up of the Super League&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The hidden code of the new website of The Guardian states that the European Super League will give fans what they want and that it will offer a sustainable and competitive environment.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also shows that the clubs are considering new ideas, including technology-enhanced rule implementation that is not backed by the authorities.The public criticism of the proposals seems to be underestimated.It says that view is rarely the case where fundamental change is involved.Differences of opinion are an essential part of being a fan and we welcome this debate.In the end, we are confident that when fans are welcomed back into the stadiums and the first Super League matches are played, fans will enjoy the greatest competition club football has ever seen.The message is that the 12 clubs had no choice but to act because of the financial costs they were facing.&lt;p&gt;

0,5,&lt;p&gt;The firing of Spurs consigns them to the past&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"It was meekly and by degrees, with an impending inevitability and perhaps even a certain mercifulness, that 'José Mourinho subsided in the same manner as so many of his teams this season.If you want to know how far his stock has fallen, consider the fact that he was not even the biggest football story of the day: one of the game's great coaches was reduced to a parish notice.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He will not be given the chance to lift the trophy for the 21st time in his career.The first thing to say is that all this has been coming.In the last few months, a promising start has given way to caution, paralysis and misery.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During last season's injury crisis, there was a certain logic to the deep, low-possession style of Mourinho's.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On his watch, Harry Kane and Son Heung-min rediscovered their best form.The way they invited pressure against mid-ranking teams such as Crystal Palace and Wolves was not simply a betrayal of Spurs recent traditions.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a self-destructive approach in a squad full of attacking talents.The thrilling, shapeshifting coach of the mid-2000s devolved into a grimacing José Mourinho tribute act as time and turmoil congealed, his preference for reactive football into a hard-wired ideology.Where did it all go wrong as he approaches his seventh decade?Daniel Levy was responsible for appointing a manager on reputation and celebrity wattage alone.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about the football?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That could take care of itself.The guy has a CV.Spurs were the first club to discover that the man is a trophy machine because of his thirst for excuses.By the end of his first season, the squad that he said was better than he had at Manchester United had been turned into a skeleton in need of investment.They came with Gedson, Matt, and Carlos.Steven Bergwijn, Pierre-Emile Hjbjerg, and Joe Rodon have shown promise.Bale, one of the feelgood signings of the summer, has been frozen out and the team's unity was destroyed in a matter of months.His players have been used as a riot shield and there have been needless feuds with Dele Alli.And to what end?&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;The absence of fans gave greedy owners their chance to grab power&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"Selling England by the pound is part 94.The European Super League may be a structural inevitability, an exciting new format, and a great sweating orgy of gullet-cramming avarice.It can't come as a surprise.This is football's latest piece of mimesis, another moment where this grand, mucked-about piece of public theatre mirrors and reflects the world around it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After grabbing all they can, the grabbing hands will raise their eyes and look for a little more.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most surprising thing so far about the news six English clubs have signed up as founder members of a mind-bogglingly lucrative private members' club masquerading as a sporting league is the identity of those parties.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Premier League, Uefa, Sky, and Mike Ashley are some of the organizations that have been included.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, that well-known protectionist and guardian of the little man Boris Johnson, who used the Margaret Thatcher Lecture to state that inequality is essential to the human order.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The politics are right up the top.Thatcherism in a pair of shorts and the moment football's richest clubs were encouraged are some of the things that will be associated with the latest move towards a return to the formation of the premier league.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open up.Barriers should be taken away.Outsource.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The English have a strange kind of sentimental socialism.Our public services can be taken by you.The only real questions worth asking are: what will it be like?Is there anything we can do to stop it, delay it or bring some concessions?Both of these require an acceptance that this is not a move in a new direction.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sheikh Mansour is the deputy prime minister of another state, duty bound to locate his ultimate loyalties elsewhere.Roman Abramovich can't live in England anymore.Some of the part-owners of Milan are notorious vulture capitalists.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important to be clear over what is being lost, because your views will not be taken down, and they will definitely not be taken into consideration.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The basic premise of open competition, connection to grassroots, geographical ties and a sense of home would be destroyed by the Super League.The product was sodden.There are elements that will be lost forever.The domestic league will be reduced in value.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will make you disengage and restyle you as a consumer.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will make you hate football, because it will cram the same substance on to your screen, and fan instead the cringing celebrity-worship that marketeers and sales people have nourished around the game.The Super League will rubbish these suggestions, because they don't fit with the values people place on football.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a concern for the support network beneath that has been pumped through the official channels.The women's game will soon have its own Super League plan, but details are very scarce.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Super League may be the end point of many things.It is a piece of opportunism born out of the Pandemic.Fans in the stadium have acted as a chorus, checks and balances for the last quarter century.In their absence, we have seen a power grab, a game that is now staged, governed and distributed entirely through a screen, and which feels suddenly free to define its own limits.There was always a fear that the thing we returned to wouldn't be the same.These things have been absent, but they still have value.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;"It is almost as if the ESL don't care about football"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;In my children\'s novel Future Friend, which I began writing in January 2020, the future is imagined as a future where no one goes out because of the presence of Viruses in the air.When it was published, I was praised by some for my psychic powers.Football is still played there, but only in one stadium, above the clouds, and only the super-rich can go and watch games there.I say just call me Nostradavidmus because of Sunday\'s Super League news.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there is one thing the European Super League is all about, it is heart and tradition.The narrative of top-flight domestic competition is all about reaching the top places in order to get into the playoffs.Which wouldn\'t exist anymore.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big clubs that are already in it could be the winners.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big clubs would lose interest in the domestic league very quickly and just play their reserves there.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other clubs battle it out to join a league with Man Utd, Chelsea, Man City,Liverpool and Spurs in it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The founding members of the ESL are not demoted.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If halfway through the season, it becomes clear that there is nothing to play for, even if there is a better, more corporate word.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are logical problems thrown up by its own format, and it doesn\'t matter how glamorous a game against Barcelona is, if there\'s nothing to play for.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One doesn\'t know where to start with the ethical ones.The fact that the ESL is slanted towards fans rich enough to fly to half the games, without knowing how outrageously high ticket prices will be, or how much flying is going to be possible or a good idea, might assume most of its paying clientele.Americans don\'t like football because it requires a certain tolerance of boredom.Americans just want the top action all the time.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The glorious moments are more glorious because of it.The dream of the European Super League is that no game is the biggest game ever.I wonder if Syndrome, the teenage villain in The Incredibles whose most famous line is, "once everyone is super, nobody is," is the secret brainchild of the ESL.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;The Big Six want to join a European Super League&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The bombshell that 12 top European clubs have joined a new "super league" was presented at 11.30pm on Sunday as a foregone conclusion.Uefa bought off previous threats by expanding the Champions League and delivering more of its revenues to the top clubs, but reality has bitten this time.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;English football is seen by many around Europe to have laid the money-driven conditions for it, in the break up to form the premier league in 1992, the relentless commercialisation since, and the openness to takeovers by investors from anywhere.The pace of change has been accelerated by the Covid-19 epidemic and the multimillion-pound losses it has caused.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The English clubs are all still in the mega-rich elite, but each has its own particular ownership, motivation and financial situation that has led it to join, along with the obvious resolve for any waverers, not to be left behind.It is astonishing to many United supporters, who led well-informed and organised campaigns against it, that the Glazers were allowed to buy one of England\'s greatest sporting institutions.In December, Woodward indicated he was working with Uefa as a member of the European Club Association board rather than pursuing a super league.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal to give the big six clubs control of the Premier League\'s commercial direction and share 25% of TV revenues with the EFL appears to have been lost.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the rejection of the plans, Henry has turned his attention more fully to the European maneuvers, and no doubt been persuaded by the revenues JP Morgan is projecting it will deliver to the chosen few clubs.The supply of Abu Dhabi\'s oil wealth to the club formerly described patronisingly by Sir Alex Ferguson as United\'s "noisy neighbours" puts City in a different position from the clubs whose US owners do not invest capital.City revealed a £126m loss for the year to 30 June 2020 this month, so covering only the first three and a half months of the epidemic, they were not going to miss out.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group that owned the club for a number of years charged the club a fee for their services.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With on- and off-field results now significantly below those of their rivals, participation in a Super League is a very big promotion for the club.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was less involved with the club after abandoning his application for a UK visa and moving to Israel.He canceled the plans for a new 60,000-seat stadium after the British authorities delayed approving his visa.After spending more than 200 million dollars on rising European stars last summer, the ambition seems to have grown again.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The owner of the club, the Bahamas-based currency trader Joe Lewis, and the chairman, Daniel Levy, will be very happy with the fact that the league will not have a place in the Football League.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The net debt of Spurs is much larger than the other clubs due to the fact that their new stadium has been empty for a year.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;Atalanta responded quickly to protectionist proposals&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Hours before 12 of Europe\'s leading football clubs announced plans for a breakaway Super League that would shield them from the consequences of sporting failure, one was busy demonstrating why such protection might be desired.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bianconeri dropped to fourth in the table as they lost at Atalanta and could have fallen out of the top four.The clubs drew, but the margin for error has evaporated.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lazio could close to within one point if they win their game in hand, but it won\'t matter.The governing bodies in Italy, Spain and England warned that any clubs or players involved in the Super League would not be allowed to play in any other competition.How quickly the threats could be acted upon remains to be seen.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past two years, the Bergamo club have been one of European football\'s fairytale stories, reaching the Champions League knockout stage in consecutive seasons on a budget that would barely cover CR7\'s wages.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agnelli said that he has great respect for what Atalanta are doing, but without any international history, and with a great sporting performance.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all the consequences that come with an economic level, think about Roma, who have contributed in recent years to maintaining Italy\'s Uefa coefficient ranking, who had one bad season and are out.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those remarks were roundly condemned, yet few recognised them as what they were: the herald of a shift among Europe\'s most powerful clubs to protect their financial interests more aggressively than ever before.There is a clue as to why 12 clubs have signed up for a European Super League: They lost a combined £1.2 billion in the previous year.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you talking about the Super League?The news focused La Repubblica splashed the story across its front page after the banner on Gazzetta dello Sport exclaimed "super no".The fundamental concept of merit has been canceled by the closed Super League.There were questions about how the proposals had affected the recent TV deal.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is hard to imagine how the result would be, but Atalanta\'s win was yet another huge result for a club continuing to defy gravity.Ruslan Malinovskiy\'s shot in the 87th minute was the difference as the match ended in a tie.The side earned the points with hard work and shrewd changes.After experimenting with a four-man defence for several weeks, the manager reverted to a back three and Atalanta were able to restrict the champions to a single shot on target in 90 minutes.Not everyone was satisfied with that explanation, following the days of speculation regarding his future that followed him throwing his shirt on the floor at the end of the win against Genoa.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;Florentino Pérez is a Real Madrid player&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;In the first interview with any of the key figures behind the plan, Florentino Pérez painted a dramatic, dark portrait of football\'s future and presented himself and the 12 breakaway clubs as its salvation as he attempted to justify plans for a Super League over which he will preside.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that the 12 clubs would not wait until 2024 for the new format of the competition.We don\'t want the rich to be richer and the poor to be poorer, that\'s what he said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to save football.The president of the Super League said in an interview that they had been working on plans for two years but had been told to do it now.He accused Uefa of lacking transparency and not having a good image and said there was no chance that the new clubs could be kicked out of the competition.He could not say how the final five places would be filled, although he said it would be based on merit.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barcelona will benefit from a better option.He understood that Laporta was sensible.According to Pérez, football has 4 billion fans around the world and yet he claimed that 40% of people between 16 and 24 were no longer interested.He said that it won\'t last long if we don\'t do something.There are lots of games of little quality; we have to change this sport to make it more attractive at all levels.The Real Madrid v Manchester United game is more attractive than the Manchester United game.The quarter-finals are the most attractive part of the league.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;The manager who was sacked by Spurs was an attack-minded one&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"Daniel Levy wants an attack-minded manager to take over.The Spurs chairman wants the replacement to have strong credentials in the development of young players and be modern in outlook.The profile is similar to that of Mauricio Pochettino, who was dismissed in November after a poor run of results.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The writing was on the wall for the manager for some time, with results and performances having nose-dived since early December and the dressing room becoming an increasingly divided and fractious place.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He will be supported by Chris Powell, who joined the club last August as the head of coaching for the same youth age groups.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that Spurs haven't won a trophy since 2008 is testament to Levy's unhappiness at Mourinho that he decided to part ways with him in the week of the showpiece.Levy is hoping for a bounce under Mason.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mason joined Spurs as a seven-year-old and Levy places great store in his knowledge of the club.His belief that he could engineer a revival was supported by a sequence of three successive league wins, but then came the derby defeat at the hands of the archrivals and it was followed by the loss at Dinamo Zagreb.Spurs had been 2-0 up after the first leg of the last 16 tie.At that point, Spurs began to field calls from agents and tell them of the profile for a potential successor.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the players at Spurs had grown tired of Mourinho's confrontational approach, his readiness to blame them for mistakes and dropped points rather than accept responsibility for the pattern of matches, which often saw the team Some players came to think that they were doing him a favor by being on the pitch, when in fact they were not.The group did not include Kane or Son Heung-min, who posted messages in support of the sacked manager.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levy has found that his manager is more dispensable than underachieving players."&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;They like to be in control and did not like Flick wresting it from them&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"It had been a week of heavy with a feeling of finality.Leon Goretzka's withdrawal through injury may have been the straw that broke the camel's back in a campaign beset with personnel issues.It felt good to move on after everything that happened with Paris Saint-Germain.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 3-2 win, propelled by another two goals from their teenage sensation Jamal Musiala, was enough to bring a buzz to the post-match dressing room.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The speaker brought a quiet to it all.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told his players that he would be leaving at the end of the season.It was very emotional for all of us.We have to process it as a team.The human cost of two seasons was acknowledged by Thomas Mller.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the start of November to the end of December, the atmosphere was completely different.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new man who was already there was tactically astute but it was more than his footballing philosophy that freed previously non-plussed players.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had a connection with the players and an uncommon mutual respect that was like gold dust.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a price for Flick to defend his players.Hasan Salihamidi's decision to move on from Jérme Boateng, telling the centre-half that his contract would not be renewed at the season's end, was seen as the potential final straw.The club is unhappy with their head coach stepping up to make his thoughts heard, which is a symptom of the lack of empathy between the two.The club said on Sunday that they disapproved of the communication by Hansi Flick and would continue the talks after the Mainz game.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said it was wrong to say what if.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can't say that I'm going to break up with the winner of Germany's Next Top Model because I've never been with her, but I can say that INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals The biggest impediment could be the 20m release clause that would be payable to Leipzig, though in an environment where they just paid 7.5m for Adi Htter, it seems far from prohibitive.They will try to move on from the highs, though he won't forget them.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They could never have imagined how hard it would be to replace him.Is it possible that Htter will play his first game after announcing he was leaving Frankfurt?Eintracht's lead in fourth to fourth was cut by four points after a loss at Gladbach, while Werder Bremen's lead was cut by four points as Erling Haaland scored twice.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friedhelm Funkel had a bad start in his first game in charge of Kln.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The defeat just down the road at Leverkusen was one thing, but the 67-year-old's post match interview with Sky caused a major storm.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are only one or two expressions you can't say about their players, who are just so fast, thanks to their speed.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some fans took to social media to demand Funkel's removal for the racially-charged inference, and the coach's attempted backtrack on Sunday and the club's efforts to diffuse the situation have been described as a communications disaster by the city's leading newspaper Express.Hertha is being put in a quark due to a Covid outbreak, with coach Pal Dardai and Dodi Lukebakio among those who have been affected.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunday's game at Mainz was postponed and they can't resume group training until 30 April, leaving them three weeks to cram in six remaining games."&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;The Super League casts a shadow over Diego Llorente&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"Oh, come on...Liverpool missed out on the chance to move into the Champions League.Who are we kidding?Not even a group that has provided so much hope and joy to their supporters in recent times could have lifted the gloom here, as Jrgen Klopp and his players are absolutely blameless in the pathetic power grab we have seen play out in the last day or so.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diego Llorente's late goal was likely to cheer many up.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It certainly raised an extra octave or two from the saxophonist outside Elland Road, who spent the entire night playing the Abba hit, Money, Money, Money.The least they deserved for their dominance in the opening 45 minutes was to be taken fourth by Sadio Mané.One of the rich, historic clubs in this country, whose history and culture has been treated with nothing other than contempt by a handful of owners, is Llorente.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you hear pundits talk about the club, it's clear that it's bigger than us.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It shows how some within the game have contempt for anything other than money.That is once again very much in the balance here after they were denied all three points by Leeds.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mané's goal on the half-hour mark, a simple tap-in after Trent Alexander-Arnold snuck in behind and squared it for the forward, looked as though it would be enough to guarantee victory here for large periods of the evening.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His thoughts on the second half of the game were the same as his thoughts on the first.He said that it causes harm to football.Football is for everyone.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Football will disappear without them.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who is going to defend the fans?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You do wonder, if we can talk about the football for a minute, how many would have reacted to a dramatic finish here at Elland Road.Patrick Bamford and Helder Costa both hit the woodwork.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not difficult to imagine that the boisterous celebrations from the home directors and the newest saxophone star were replicated all across the country after a corner from Harrison was met by the head of Llorente."&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;The heat is on as another United old boy hands Miami a defeat&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"The holidays are over for new Inter Miami coach Phil Neville.The former England women's coach, who spoke fondly of annual family vacations on South Beach during his playing days, tasted defeat in his first game in MLS, as LA Galaxy came from behind twice to earn a late 3-2 win at DRV PNK Stadium.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The visitors sealed the points thanks to substitute Sacha Kljestan's calm finish with nine minutes left.He said after the game that he didn't think his team deserved to lose, because they were the team that created the most chances, opportunities and shots.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the oppressive south Florida heat, the side were well-organised, pressed intelligently, and made key intercepts in good areas to exploit the space in front of the Galaxy back line.Higuan could have done better with numerous opportunities before laying on the opener for Robinson in first.The goal sent the crowd into raptures with fireworks.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They waited a long time for the home opener.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The occasion was everything if you take the result aside.You get these occasions in your career, and I have had plenty of them, but our supporters were amazing.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we haven't had supporters for a long time, you forget how important they are to the whole of football.Miami's home opener seemed to be following the script, until it didn't.This fixture, carefully plotted to involve Beckham's old club, was postponed last March just three days prior to kick-off.The game that never was, with the date 14 March 2020, was given out today by Inter Miami.Beckham, an almost daily presence at the team's training facility, was finally able to salute those in attendance before the nationally televised match.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fourth place World Cup finish was not much more than a par round.There was plenty of evidence that Miami will be a force in the Eastern Conference for more than an hour of this game.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They had an attacking anchor to build around and looked good in possession.Robinson and Higuan complemented each other well before all three waned.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team still faces challenges in the weeks to come, beyond putting points on the board.MLS commissioner Don Garber confirmed on Sunday that the club will be punished for breaking league budgeting rules.The club expects the full 18,000 capacity to be available at some point this season after limited tickets for Sunday's game sold out.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the novelty of having a soccer team wears off, the city's recent sporting history suggests attendance will be largely results- dependent.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inter Miami are playing their home games in Fort Lauderdale until their new stadium is built in Freedom Park, which is 30 miles away.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it is ever built.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hastily constructed DRV PNK stadium is an admirably fine stopgap, but also a far cry from the vision of a downtown 25,000-seater stadium on Miami's glitzy waterfront Beckham proposed when announcing his plans in 2014).Phil is his old mate."&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;The form team is MonacoCould they win the title?&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"This season has seen the land of the unexpected.Paris Saint-Germain have lost the same number of home league games as in the previous seven seasons combined, and even Raymond Domenech found his way back into the league, as promoted Lens are on the verge of Europe.The most eye-catching story of the season has been Monaco's surprise title charge.Monaco have been marooned in a state of change since they won the Ligue 1 title.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monaco's latest attempt to rip everything up and start again appeared to be the reason for Moreno's removal.The season has not been the same after the ruthless dismissal of Moreno.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vice president of Monaco said in December that he was a leader because he was a player and a coach.He is charismatic with the players.The way players behave when he talks is outstanding.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His style is very intensive, attacking football.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kovac started slowly and Monaco sat seventh at Christmas after an eight wins in his first 17 league games.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monaco have become the best side in the league.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have won 16 of 19 games they have played in the year 2021.Balance has been key.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The policy of carefully scouting, recruiting and developing young talents alongside more experienced and proven players worked during Jardim's first tenure but then jumped the shark after the title win.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burgeoning talents who are ready for a step up, such as Aurélien Tchouaméni (Bordeaux, 21) and Youssouf Fofana (Strasbourg, 22), who signed last January alongside summer defensive additions.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All have been nurtured by experienced players such as Cesc Fbregas, Wissam Ben Yedder, Kevin Volland and Stevan Jovetic.Despite being shipped off for a loan in Ligue 2 and being kept on the bench by Henry, attackingMidfielderSofiane Diop has been transformed as a skillful, illusive creator and he often keeps Aleksandr Golovin on the bench.The Monaco squad is full of players who have improved or subverted expectations.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monaco are often devastating.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monaco gradually transitioned into a 3-6-1 shape.The greatest asset of Kovac is collectivism.Monaco are similar to their coach.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lille took a point from Montpellier on Friday night to close the gap to the top.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday lunchtime, they were given the chance to go within a point.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a goalless 75 minutes, all hell broke loose at the Parc des Princes as Saint-tienne went ahead.Paris Saint-Germain were level less than 30 seconds later thanks to a sumptuous Ander Herrera pass and a deft touch from Kylian Mbappé.Mauro Icardi headed home the winner with virtually the last touch after Saint-tienne's Romain Hamouma tied the game in injury time.The jubilation in Paris showed how far Ligue 1 has come this season.Previously, a 3-2 home win over one of their favourite punching bags would be cause for inquiry rather than celebration.Lyon travels to Monaco a week later.The winners of the most thrilling of title races will be decided by the two meetings.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;There are 10 things to look out for this weekend&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"They can prepare for the second leg of their match with Paris Saint-Germain by winning the premier league.If Manchester City take three points at Selhurst Park on Saturday, they will be guaranteed another title.With that in mind, he can hold back many of the players he plans to start against PSG and still be confident of giving Palace what they want.Having played without a goal in Paris, City could deploy both Gabriel Jesus andSergio Agero against Palace, giving Kevin De Bruyne a chance to rest.John Stones will definitely not play, with his suspension giving Aymeric Laporte a chance in central defence and possibly keep his place for the following league match, which happens to be against Chelsea, a potential opponent in the Champions League final.The Crystal Palace v Manchester City game will be on Saturday at 12.30pm.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Brendan Rodgers's team come calling again on Friday, Saints must be proactive, dynamic and ambitious, at the risk of being picked off by visitors who are aiming to wrap up qualification for the Champions League as quickly as possible.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the good work Hasenhttl has done atSouthampton is not crumbling away.While a decent result was missed, it was also a missed opportunity.An opponent escaped a serious beating.There was an early chance that was blown.His tame, side-footed attempt gave Thibaut Courtois the chance to make a save.Last week at West Ham, he scored his third goal in 32 appearances, grabbing three vital points in the race for the top four.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His performance in Villa's last match was not bad but it was not good enough.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was too often on the fringes of the action.It would be no surprise if he didn't start either of the games.If there is one uncapped Englishman who deserves a call-up, it is Ezri Konsa.Steve Bruce always said that when they got their best players back, they would be alright, and a run of two wins and two draws has taken them to relative safety.The return from injury of Allan Saint-Maximin and Callum Wilson has made a huge difference, but it is also worth noting that their upturn in form has coincided with Sean Longstaff regaining his place in the first XI.Longstaff was a target for Manchester United, an unremarkable circumstance in and of itself, except Longstaff was recommended by Michael Carrick, who knows something about deep-lying midfield behavior, while his brother coached the player, so knows something about his character.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the more watchable games of the weekend will be one of the new players and style changes that will leave them well-equipped to attack next season.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two interim managers, neither with any hope of landing the gig permanently, meet each other in Sunday evening's graveyard shift.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan Mason was powerless to prevent Spurs from losing the Carabao Cup final to Manchester City, while Paul Heckingbottom got his first win after five straight defeats.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the cloud of speculation of who might take over their club on a full-time basis, both must forge on.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red tape may be a stumbling block for Alexander Blessin, who has been heavily linked with the Blades.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The architect of the Red Bull coaching school that produced Blessin is said to be on a list of candidates that includes the Ajax manager.The bigger jobs now go to a smaller pool.The game is on Sunday at 7.15pm."&lt;p&gt;

0,5,&lt;p&gt;"Jones will be Brady's successor as Fields heads to Bears"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"There was little surprise at the No 1 overall pick in Thursday night's event.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the best college prospects in decades was selected by the Jacksonville Jaguars.The San Francisco 49ers, who had traded up for the third pick, were the first surprise.After starting the draft process in January, the 49ers made that decision official when they drafted him, despite speculation that Alabama's Mac Jones would be the choice.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was going to go whichever way it went.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was crazy to watch, but no one knows anything.It has been enjoyable to watch.Lance started only 17 games at North Dakota State, where he displayed a strong arm, mobility and mastery of a pro-style offense against lesser competition.Lance played one game in 2020 because the season was moved to the spring because of the coronaviruses.His production in the year was off the charts, as he threw for 2,786 yards and ran for 1, 159 yards.The Chicago Bears traded up nine spots with the New York Giants to draft Ohio State quarterback Justin Fields with the No 11 overall pick.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;"Reports say that Rodgers doesn't want to return to the Packers"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"The relationship between Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers could be headed for a messy divorce amid reports that the quarterback has told some people he doesn't want to return.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to rebuild bridges with Rodgers, the Packers have had their president, general manager and head coach fly out on separate occasions.Both the San Francisco 49ers and the Los Angeles Rams have made inquiries about trading for the reigning NFL Most Valuable Player in recent months, but were both turned down.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 49ers will almost certainly draft a quarterback in Thursday night's draft, while the Rams traded for Matthew Stafford.The news opens the way for teams to make a play for Rodgers in the coming days of the draft.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The possibility was brought up by the man he beat to this season's Most Valuable Player, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes.The Packers and Rodgers have been negotiating a long-term extension for weeks but that the quarterback has not come close to agreeing a deal.He has only reached one Super Bowl, while the likes of Manning and Brady have won many.The Packers chose to take a quarterback in the first-round last year, instead of giving Rodgers weapons that could help him reach another Super Bowl.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;Lewis Hamilton will join a boycott of social media&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Lewis Hamilton will add his support to the social media boycott taking place this weekend across English sport aimed at putting pressure on online platforms to tackle racism, abuse and discrimination.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the Portuguese Grand Prix in Portimo, Hamilton said personal experience gave the initiative particular resonance.He said that he was subject to abuse when he was younger, while he was reading social media.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I took some time when I stepped back.I don\'t feel like I need validation, I generally don\'t go searching for that stuff, and I think the social media companies need to do more.We have to be pushing towards creating a more anti-racist society because they are able to take steps.Hamilton was an outspoken supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement last season after the death.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I support the initiative because social media platforms need to do more to combat this.It is understood that F1 is not joining the boycott because the sport does not suffer abuse on social media.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They offer support but will not be formally joining the boycott, stating: "We continue to work with all platforms and our own audiences to promote respect and positive values and put a stop to racism."All social media accounts including those of players, teams and organizations will fall silent in an attempt to make them act against racism and abuse.In Portugal, he gave the clearest indication yet that he will do so, citing his desire to continue pursuing equality and diversity as a strong motivation to keep racing.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is still a lot of work to be done in this sport and I know that I can help change that.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don\'t know how long I can stay.&lt;p&gt;

0,5,&lt;p&gt;Mikel Arteta is a big fan of Bukayo Saka&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"Despite losing the first leg of their semi-finals, Mikel Arteta believes that the team has a good chance of reaching the final.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicolas Pépé scored a vital away goal from the spot after Trigueros was judged to have committed a foul, but it was not overturned by the VAR.It is incredible that VAR does not act.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I put my feet on the ground because I didn't want to touch him.The referee might be told by the VAR that my feet are on the ground.I was surprised when they said it was a penalty.Unai Emery said VAR should be able to give justice in such a clearcut situation.He did not accept his formation because it did not have a specialist.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;The big ship is ready to turn around&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;With the short-lived European Super League still fresh in the minds of apathetic supporters at Old United and beyond, one wonders if they have won a few more hearts of late.Ian Evatt is the manager of the League Two club.One of my goals is to stop people from wearing Manchester United kits.I want the young kids and future fans to be wearing our shirts.If we can do things right on and off the pitch with this club, hopefully, we will capture some new fans and build our fan base.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They fell to 22nd, the lowest position in their history, after starting with three defeats to nil and then dropping to 20th, when an unthinkable third straight relegation was not out of the question.Evatt says: "Because of the size of the club, we have a huge target on our backs and that has been difficult this season."It probably helped us not to have the fans because it gave us time to get our act together.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since joining the strikers, the first player to score more than a dozen goals in a season since Michael Ricketts in 2001), the captain Antoni Sarcevic and the defender, the three of 20 arrivals, have impressed.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goalkeeping coach Matt Gilks, who played with Evatt in the premier league, has been present ever since.We needed a brand-new squad.It was going to take some time.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He guided Barrow into the Football League with an expansive style.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relentless, by Michael Jordan\'s former personal trainer, is one of the books the 39-year-old former defender likes to read.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bolton is inspired by the Argentine\'s "Murderball", an 11-v-11 training exercise where the ball is always in play.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guys appreciate it because they know how hard it is.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It makes you stronger.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no set pieces.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three blocks we do are necessary for their fitness levels.It could be 10 minutes or 15 minutes, but it is very intense.As soon as the ball goes out of play, one of the server puts the ball back in.Evatt says, "Our goal all season has been to get promoted and now we have a wonderful opportunity."&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;Talking horses set up a rivalry&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"Energumene maintained his perfect record over fences and confirmed he is likely to be Shishkin\'s biggest rival in the two-mile chasing division next season with an emphatic front-running success in the Grade One Ryanair Novice Chase at Punchestown on Thursday evening."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s like Christmas coming again if you get that feeling over two miles in chases twice in a week.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has the right to take everything on next season.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are going to meet at some point and it will be a cracking spectacle.Energumene completed a Grade One double for Willie Mullins after he toyed with his opponents in the Ladbrokes Champion Stayers Hurdle.But he was strong in the betting at 5-1 and was in contention under Patrick Mullins just as flooring Porter faded rapidly after making the running to two out.Mullins was still motionless with his partner on a tight rein.She got the 7lb mares allowance from most of her rivals and had six lengths or more to spare over both Epatante and Sharjah.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;I joined the social media boycott because football can be a force for good&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"For as long as prejudice and abuse exists in society, it will always exist on social media, but that doesn\'t mean we have to take it, excuse it, or ignore it."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are men who think it is okay to slide into my direct messages with rose.I don\'t get a lot of messages.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I get tired because my skin shouldn\'t have to be thick.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is depressing to imagine what it would be like to double the volume of messages I receive.It is an act of solidarity.An act of solidarity with the likes of Marcus Rashford, Lauren James, Axel Tuanzebe, Romaine Sawyers, Karen Carney, Reece James, Alex Jankewitz, Anthony Martial, Alex Scott and all the others who have joined a seemingly ever increasing lineup of footballers and people associated It should not be the progressive voices that are silenced.Those taking part are notplatforming themselves and handing over these powerful tools to the abusers who will have free rein to scream their obscenities and prejudices into the online ether.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a large proportion of the domestic football family, which includes the Football Association, the Premier League, the EFL, the Women\'s Super League, the Women\'s Championship and the LMA.The final day of the women\'s Championship season is painfully aware as a women\'s football writer.There will be no online fanfare or celebrations when the title is lifted at Filbert Way, where they play their first game on Sunday.Social media has been critical to the growth of women\'s football, providing access to live scores, results, match updates: information that has historically not been available elsewhere and, in the case of the Championship and lower leagues, is still often very hard to find.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope to be able to contribute where I can and where appropriate, by taking part in this boycott.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Divisions in society run deep and these are the conversations that interest me.Football fans in England were united by the European Super League saga.Football bridged society\'s gaps where politicians failed.It showed that fans have the power to change.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;35 years ago, Snooker loopy became an unlikely smash hit&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Snooker loopy is a new record.It is an example of public bar singalong, but Barry Hearn is confident that the events in the Crucible Theatre over the next 17 days will ensure that it gets into the hit parade.Michael Calvin was not a fan of the upcoming collaboration between the Matchroom Mob and Chas & Dave.Snooker is the most successful modern sport and no one has exploited its commercial potential more successfully than Barry Hearn.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pair knew what worked when it came to writing and performing singles that would appeal to the general public.There was enough material available to pen a song that would be released to coincide with the World Snooker Championship in 1986.Each player involved had their own section in the song.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if they don\'t like the sport, there must be a generation of people who know the sequence of colours because of Snooker loopy.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then screw back the yellow, green, brown, blue, pink and black.The first player under the spotlight in the song was Mao, who had the memory of a goldfish.Regardless of whether he won or lost, Meo would always cry.The two men ran with this.Meo said, "I always pipe me eyeballs."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mind is old.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He pots a lot now.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hair, or lack of it, was featured for the next two lines.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Willie Thorne was teased about his hair because he had a shiny pate.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Willie Thorne had his hair all gone and his mates all took the rise.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video shows Davis and Griffiths trying to keep the light out of Thorne\'s eyes.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not fair to give off that glare.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis took his turn.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve was very close to winning the snooker crown last year, but the black ball wouldn\'t go down, so he never got to put it on his ginger nut.The defeat to Taylor in 1985 had been a low for Davis, but it was a marketing dream for the sport.Many of the stars were signed up to the Matchroom stable.He doesn\'t care who wins this year.Davis said that Joe Johnson had not read the lyrics.The 150-1 outsider shocked everyone when he won the tournament.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We thought we were the dogs.The Matchroom Mob once again collaborated with Chas & Dave.The UK public were not sold on the Romford Rap.The Matchroom Mob\'s involvement in the music industry ended when the single reached No 91 in the charts.As the sport reached saturation point and slowly the players of the 1980s started to fade away, Snooker loopy became a soundtrack to a time when the public could not get enough of the green baize action.Even if I write this with a slight nostalgic bias, it seems we all were back then.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;The Wigan win over Hull was marred by a racism allegation&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The Wigan coach has promised the club will address any allegations of racism "head on" after one of his players, Tony Clubb, was placed on report.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there is an investigation, the Warriors will take the matter very seriously.He said he had no comment until we got to the bottom of the allegation.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will follow the correct protocols as a club.If it is brought up, we will take it head on.Clubb did not return to the field for the second half after being substituted, but he insisted it was not because of the allegation.His side made it six consecutive wins in all competitions after edging a hard-fought contest to end Hull\'s own perfect start.He is pretty upset.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;There is a big semi-final lead over Shaun Murphy&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"Kyren Wilson produced a stellar display to take command of his World Snooker Championship semi-final against Shaun Murphy and lead 6-2 after the opening session.Wilson, the runner-up toRonnie O'Sullivan in last year's tournament at the Crucible, made three century breaks.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murphy was stuck to his seat as back-to-back centuries in frames five and six, breaks of 121 and 127, put Wilson 6-1 up and looked impossible to stop.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the interval the match referee spoke to both players and the table was brushed heavily and the cue ball changed, but when asked if that was the problem, Selby did not think that was the case.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He took a 3-1 lead into the first interval after losing the first frame to a 60 break.It was not detrimental as he later cut in a brilliant long yellow and cleared the table, even though he failed on a yellow at 56-31.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They looked a different player when they came back after the change of ball.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 92-break, the highest of the afternoon, immediately made it 3-2 before in the next frame, the chance to return to the table and a break of 38 evened the score."&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;Damage was found after the brain of a player was donated for research&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"The first contact sportswoman in Australia to have her brain donated to the Australian Sports Brain Bank has died.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White matter changes and repeated head injury have been linked to the development of mental illness and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain bank has received donations from male contact sport athletes before.Both were found to have severe cases of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a neurodegenerative disease attributed to their playing careers.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of four seasons, she played 23 games for the Greater Western Sydney club.The findings on her brain have opened up new areas of inquiry in sports concussion, according to the brain bank.She previously represented Australia in baseball, playing at five World Cups, and was also an American football quarterback in the short-lived LFL Australia, and later in the United States.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a long-term career in contact sport is becoming widely accepted as a substantial risk factor for the development of CTE, less well understood is how white matter changes in the brain from non-concussive or sub-con.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White matter injury was found around the altered vessels.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hadn't noticed that before in other subjects, but we haven't had many athlete donors as young as Jacinda before.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes to the white matter of the brain have been observed in contact sports players after a single season.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two areas of research have not coalesced.The white matter damage from concussions and head injuries can affect mental illness.There is white matter damage and blood vessel damage as well.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She donated to the brain bank because she wanted to help people and be a shining light for other women in the games.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important that we balance the ledger here and not just talk about men all the time, because research is biased towards men in this area.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to make sure that scientific research doesn't just reinforce harmful social stereotypes.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US, very few women have come through the studies.In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.Samaritans can be reached in the UK and Ireland by email or phone.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are other international helplines at www.befrienders.org."&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Rugby has a stake in the All Blacks&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"New Zealand Rugby has moved a step closer to selling a stake in the game after the nation's provincial unions voted unanimously to give the green light to a huge deal with a US investment firm.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should the deal be rubber stamped, a large portion of the money would be funnelled into grassroots rugby, which has suffered from falling participation numbers.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The operating loss blew out from the $5m budget before Covid, which included a NZ$16m writedown of Sky Television shares.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silver Lake has a portfolio of stakes in sporting clubs around the world, including the UFC, Manchester City, A-League's Melbourne City and the NBA.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They would have done their homework.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright said they are not mugs.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The All Blacks played six times last year.They might play 15 times this year.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The All Blacks will want to play as much as possible in order to get that return on investment."&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;"Baseball's rules were made to be broken"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"On Saturday the Los Angeles Dodgers hosted the San Diego Padres in what has become baseball's hottest rivalry.After taking a chest-high cutter from the Dodgers'Trevor Bauer on the game's first pitch for a strike, Fernando Tatis Jr struck back on the very next throw, essentially hitting the exact same pitch.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was your classic cut-to-the-chase moment, one of baseball's biggest bats getting over on its reigning Cy Young winner.What came next was even more shocking.As Tatis was rounding first base, he slowed down, looked back and cupped a hand over his right eye.Baseball is a sanctified thing that should only be played in a certain way, and this was the real shot for baseball fans.Deadpan.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is hard to hit in the big leagues.In a 13-minute video, Bauer broke down the celebrations.After the first home-run pitch, Bauer gives Tatis high marks for calling back to the one-eyed stare that Bauer flashed at the Padres hitters he retired during spring training.After the second home-run pitch, which missed the outside of the plate by a foot, Bauer continues to Bauer said that he had an issue with this location and that he had to go for it.There needs to be more of a shoulder swing.The arms are not open.The head needs to move a bit.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curry does a shoulder shimmy.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jordan shrugged.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His chest was beating and he was stepping.These aren't the only moments that make Jamie Foxx look like himself.Fans tuning in for the next game are the moments that get them.The soccer pitch has a lot of time for goal scorers to indulge themselves.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are taunting one another and watching a show.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though most of them know that the melodrama is scripted, there is something about the passion and the emotion that spills over the top that speaks to them.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thing that always rings true is if America's pastime were truly this hallowed training ground for instilling fairness and merit in leaders of tomorrow.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The racial, political and economic problems that still divide us are explained by baseball.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A game where the only object is to hit a small, fast- moving ball with a long slender stick is called a game.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let that man remind us not to take the spectacle for granted if no one throws up gang signs or drags a finger across the throat.The kids could do with more stand-out moments like the one at Dodger Stadium last Saturday.On the other side, there was avenging and building on the Dodgers rivalry.Bauer was taking his time while giving a lesson in how to resolve and escalate a conflict at the same time.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best of them can be brought out of a little conflict.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So be it, if that should happen with the flip of a bat.Bring it on, baby."&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;Iwabuchi wants to show girls in Japan how to play football&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Mana Iwabuchi is not your average footballer.She won the World Cup at the age of 18 and was a member of Japan\'s most successful women\'s club.She joined Villa in a high-profile transfer at the start of the year because she had spent her adult life in the glare of the spotlight.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I liked playing football.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After I became an adult, I became more aware of the pressure.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the Covid-19 difficulties, the newly mature Iwabuchi is convinced her decision to leave INAC Kobe Leonessa in her homeland and head back to Europe is the right one.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The restrictions in place have complicated the bedding in process, but Iwabuchi admits she has yet to get to know the city.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The style is different, and I feel like I am learning a new type of football.While studying the good points of English football, she acknowledges the strengths of the Japanese game, citing technique as an advantage.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I do well, Japanese players will gain a good reputation and others will get the chance to come to England.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I represent Japan as a person, not just as a footballer.The conversation turns to the growing activism among athletes such as Megan Rapinoe and Naomi Osaka.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upcoming Olympics in Tokyo is one topic generating plenty of debate, and Iwabuchi concedes it is an incredibly delicate situation.As a player, I hope the competition goes ahead, but with the current situation around the world and the states of emergency in Japan, I can\'t say for certain.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be disappointing if the Games were to be canceled, but I feel like in the past year I have been able to prepare myself for either outcome.It will be difficult as there won\'t be places to relax.There is a lot of worry about what to do if you test positive for a drug.Iwabuchi looks at the possibility of achieving glory and further inspiring the next generation of female players in Japan, if the competition goes ahead.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;The passion of young Muslims is off the scale&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;It has just gone 10pm on Tuesday in Edgbaston\'s cavernous indoor school, usually closed at this late hour, is echoed with the cheers and laughter of some friendly but competitive cricket being played.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is believed to be the first of its kind in the country, with four teams from the existing Chance to Shine projects playing six-a-side games every Tuesday and Friday night.Their transport is paid for and, after prayers on the pitch, the taped-up tennis ball that is synonymous with subcontinental cricket starts to be deflated.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covid19 restrictions mean this initial tournament can be played only by 16- to 18-year-olds but the intention in future years is to open it up to adults and swell the numbers.Gordon spotted a chance to further the county\'s ties with the Muslim population by heading up the newACE programme, which was designed to engage with the Afro-Caribbean community.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They would play 24/7.Other counties are also aware of that.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mohammed Arif, a well-known development coach in these parts, says: "Some parents say their kids are supposed to be at the mosque after Iftar."Some of these kids have never been out of their postcodes before and parents worry, so we are putting on an event that is for both minds and bodies.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are aware of that.We help with any anxiety by being trained in mental-health first aid.The aim of the scheme and similar daytime projects for girls is more than just cricket.One example is Manan Janjua, a 17-year-old leg-spinner who moved to the UK from Norway with his family five years ago and says Chance to Shine cricket helped him to learn English and make friends.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I now know Kadeer and Moeen Ali very well and can call on them for advice whenever I need it.Things may have been different if I had done it back then.There is a lack of coaches from the same background to the talent pool in English cricket.There are two British Asian pathway coaches who can help guide the next generation at the club.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;Manchester United hit Roma for six&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"This victory, secured despite a 2-1 deficit at half-time, had the feel of the next major step in the evolution of Ole Gunnar Sols.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Smalling's foul on Edinson Cavani appeared to be the latter falling over, but United's talisman made no mistake.This was the first time a team have scored six in a major continental semi-final since Real Madrid in 1964.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another elimination would be a fifth last-four reverse under the manager and serious questions would be asked about their ability to break the psychological barrier that separates also-rans from winners.It was that Solskjaer sent out a strong lineup that included Edinson Cavani up front, Paul Pogba wide left and David de Gea in goal.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same emotion swept across the visitors when Fernandes put United ahead: Shaw tapped to Pogba, who rolled Smalling and found Cavani.As Pau Lpez advanced, the forward passed to the Portuguese, who put the ball over the goalkeeper.Rick Karsdorp's cross hit the arm of the Frenchman who was skidding along the turf, but the spot-kick was given.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A curving 25-yard effort had Lopez flying left before he became the second visitor to be replaced after he injured a shoulder.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antonio Mirante took the gloves and drove in a free-kick from the left.Smalling was the one who headed it away, and he was happy for Edindzko for the cute goal.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They could not stop the man from sliding home despite trying to sandwich him.The 35-year-old has six strikes in total here, four of which were previously in Manchester City livery, the other in that of Wolfsburg.Smalling blocked Mirante's follow-up attempt after he saved a low attempt.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They started with an equalizing goal that showed how ruthless their play can be.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cavani's lay-off went to the ever-lurking Fernandes.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once more, his return ball to Cavani was instant, and the Uruguayan slammed home for his 11th goal of the season.Pogba and Shaw combined before the left-back's cross teed up the strikers but his radar was awry, as United were back in high gear.His next act was a reverse pass to Scott McTominay, who crossed when he might have shot.But Cavani made no mistake when he finally claimed a second of the night: the ball went from Shaw to Pogba to Wan-Bissaka, left to right.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;Nicolas Pépé scored from the spot to give the team a chance&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;After stepping back from the edge, they turned towards the final.When they were down to 10 men and trailing 2-0 through goals from Manu Trigueros and Ral Albiol, they were on the verge of falling at the hands of the manager they had sacked.Mikel Arteta\'s side went down in Spain, but they didn\'t go out, Nicolas Pépé scoring the away goal that provides something to build on in seven days\' time.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first hour, there would be something of a revival because of the result.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It feels like Gdansk is within reach.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a feeling of lost opportunity for Villarreal.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trigueros said that they got out of here alive.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had a point when he said that the victim on the penalty changed the shape of the tie.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was an opportunity to reach their first final at the expense of the team that denied them 15 and it was understandable that it hurt.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a banner across the street.It said, "Our history, our dream, our moment."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the fifth semi-final for Villarreal.They had fallen four times before, but none hurt more than against Arsenal.The only fans were cardboard cutouts, and the first glimpse of revenge was silently visible.It was also swiftly, too.It took five minutes for them to take the lead.A weak link was identified and exploited early by Juan Foyth, who was repeatedly allowed to step forward.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a while, a lifeline appeared.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a tumble over Trigueros that had Artur Dias pointing to the spot again.Emery insisted that it shouldn\'t have been given, but this time there was no turning back and Pépé scored.When Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang drew a smart save in the final minute, it could have been the difference between the two teams.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;Kyle Walker makes his case for greatness&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"It was about 40 minutes into the semi-final on Wednesday night that Kyle Walker made the first of his trademark sprints up the right wing.The classic jet-powered Walker burst seems to have a comic-book quality.As he goes, smoke billows from him.Cars are thrown aside in his wake.A businessman gets coffee all over his suit.With half-time looming, City's all-action hero had finally decided to join the party, but a minute later Walker nipped in front of Kylian Mbappe and produced the intercept.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is fast.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has pace.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don't last four seasons as a full-back in a Guardiola team if you're nothing.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full-back has perhaps the most complex and demanding role on the pitch, with a heady cocktail of tactical intelligence, technical ability and physical resilience.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of Philipp Lahm and David Alaba.Walker has held this role down all the way through the greatest era in the history of the city.In a culture fixated on the newest, shiniest young thing, his age and Englishness may be a factor.There is a tendency in this country for young players to suffer from media saturation, with the effect that by the time they are through their mid-20s people have simply tired of them.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know you are not an average player.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He shrugged and said that you are actually quite good.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wanted to believe it, but he wasn't quite sure.There is a self-deprecating streak on the pitch.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was discipline before the fireworks of the second half, when the threat of Paris Saint-Germain on the break was at its most potent.Walker barely got out of his own half in those first 40 minutes, when he narrowed his position to squeeze the channels, when they tried to work the ball through he stepped up and made a tactical foul, when he got on the ball he curbed his natural instincts.The field was empty and chastened.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walker had spent the night sweeping them into his back pockets.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was, in short, the complete full-back performance: a performance worthy of Lahm or Joshua Kimmich or any of his more illustrious counterparts.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walker isn't the world's most technically gifted full-back.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes he makes the odd error.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His form fluctuates.He never hides.On a night when City's opponents engaged in a sort of collective disappearing act from the cross that wasn't cleared to the wall that didn't exist, there is something to be said for that.Maybe your loyalties still lie with Trent Alexander-Arnold.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has the chance to win the league.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will do in the meantime if that is not greatness."&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;Barcelona had a chance to go top of La Liga&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"Ronald Koeman lamented his side's inefficiency at both ends of the pitch as they blew the chance to go top of La Liga on Thursday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lionel Messi, who opened the scoring in the 23rd minute, missed a glorious chance.Bara's second defeat in 23 games means they are no longer in charge of their own destiny in the title race.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to accept the fact that we have lost.We had chances to win the game.We have five more games to go and we have a chance.We need to move on and prepare for the next one.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to know what I said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is rude towards me.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will have to do something if they put something in the referee's report."&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;Erik ten Hag is looking for a new manager&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Spurs want to talk to ten Hag about their managerial position once his team have wrapped up the Ediviresie title and they need only a point at home to Emmen on Sunday to make sure.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 51-year-old is happy at Ajax, where he enjoys a good relationship with the director of football, but having been at the club since December 2017, he could be ready for a new challenge.He is committed to front-foot football and has brought through many young players.Rangnick, who influenced Nagelsmann and a host of other young coaches, has worked as a manager and director of football.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is no longer working.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan Mason has been put in charge of Spurs until the end of the season because Brendan Rodgers is committed toLeicester.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;Football Welcomes gave Shaygan Banisaeid the chance to realise his dream&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Shaygan Banisaeid says he learned English by watching Match of the Day.I remember the first time I heard the word crossbar, it was on TV.Less than two years after he left his family in Iran to begin a new life in Europe, those linguistic skills have certainly proved useful for Banisaeid.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Football Welcomes gave me the chance to become a coach.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found courage in trying to follow my passion after getting the experience.During April the Football Welcomes Community Project has been running football sessions for women and men who are refugees or seeking asylum.It is done with partners from several clubs.They offer English classes, as well as training in coaching or refereeing, with Banisaeid proof that the initiatives can lead to a career.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was excited when I tried to analyse what they were doing.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought I wanted to be a football coach rather than a player.There were a lot of things that changed my life.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn\'t plan it but I\'m happy now.Being away from my family is hard.We haven\'t seen each other in two years, but hopefully we\'ll see each other soon.He had to remain patient as all grassroots football was suspended until the start of April, but he can now follow his passion and do what he loves.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am really proud.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have achieved the goal that I had a year ago.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my goals is to become a manager and I am really passionate about it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I try to enjoy every second of the journey and see where it leads me.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people here have a lot of opportunities that are available to them but they don\'t use them so I try to make them realise what is possible if they put in the effort.Since the last days of Paolo Maldini, I have followed AC Milan.If I want to coach them in San Siro, I need to hurry up because they are moving to a new stadium soon.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;West Ham andNewcastle are interested in signing Mario Lemina&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"The 27-year-old has made 17 Premier League starts so far this season during his loan spell with Cottagers, who have an option to make his transfer permanent.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are seven points adrift of a safe position and just five matches remaining.After spending last season on a loan at Galatasaray in Turkey, Lemina still has two years left on his contract and is not part of the squad.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Danny Ings is set to miss Friday evening's game at home toLeicester due to a hamstring injury, with the Saints manager unsure when he will return.Ademola Lookman is a target forLeicester but could be given an opportunity in Germany under new manager Jesse Marsch.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last-minute defeats will have an effect on the players.We can no longer say there is a lot of games left because we can no longer say we are in the race.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe we can, and if we do, is our picture different?It is my job to keep banging that drum and if my players think it is over I need to try and change that mindset."&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;The Manchester City players were calm after the win&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"Manchester City were overrun by an impressive Paris Saint-Germain side in the opening 45 minutes and entered the interval trailing to Marquinhos.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;City dominated after the break, as Kevin De Bruyne's cross sailed into the net to level things up before Ryoko's free-kick gave them another vital away goal.PSG ended the match all at sea after Idrissa.Everyone played safe and didn't have a personality to play with.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second half was much better because we regained the ball quickly.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They made a good build up and got Marco Verratti in front of us.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We wanted to score more and were aggressive with the ball.It's only half of the job done.The equation is simple, if we play shy and not who we are, everything can happen.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second leg will be different.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The players were calm in the locker room.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no cheering.Now we go to Crystal Palace on Saturday with an incredible opportunity to win the league and three days later try to play a good game against Paris Saint-Germain again and reach the final.You need to believe in football.We will approach the game the same as we did tonight.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;Manchester City was going to suffer against Paris Saint-Germain&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Manchester City can become the first team in the club\'s history to reach a European final if they beat Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If City can control their emotions and perform with the belief that has taken them to the brink of a third Premier League title in four seasons, they will be in a good position to make their first ever appearance on European football\'s biggest stage.We have been waiting for this moment for a long time, and we are not going to play 90 minutes like we did in Paris.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is not going to happen.I would love it, but it is not going to happen.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have to understand that there is going to be a big battle, a tough game and moments to suffer, but we are going to react well and impose what we have to do.It is going to happen.How big our good moments will be, and how quickly we will play where we want to play are what will make the difference.The players own it after that.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you can forget what you have to do, which is win the game, when you are thinking about the final.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His team have suffered a number of European defeats this season, including an away goals defeat by Spurs in the quarter-finals.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sport is unpredictable and it can surprise in a good way or a bad way.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was disappointing at the time but life always gives you another chance and it was nice to be here again.Maybe tomorrow we play a bad game, but we have learned from that.If the other team is better, we will congratulate them, but at the same time, we will play an incredible game and reach the final.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He started an individual training session and we will see if he can be with the team in the end.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is one day left.We didn\'t know if he was available or not.He said that he is going to play.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope he can play in the game because PSG\'s best performances in the competition this season have come away from home.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;City came from behind to win in Paris and John Stones insists they are confident.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a huge confidence boost.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn\'t easy to show the character and resilience to come from behind, but after the game we were proud and satisfied.Those are big moments in the league.We can thrive off of them and bring them into these next 90 minutes.It was a huge victory and I am very confident in the guys.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;Structural problems are not making anyone in football happy&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Last weekend was the most productive yet in The Fiver\'s campaign to stop football.On Friday afternoon, the punditocracy downed social-media-disgrace tools for 81 hours, the resulting peace and quiet acting as a form of cyberdouche, cleaning hot takes from every corner of the internet.It\'s silent bliss andbacteria-free too.Old Manchester fell to protesters good and true, this being long past the time when The Man needs telt.Football was stopped for two hours.The work of the Fiver was done.The best thing about The Man getting telt was imagining the high priests of patter and jonesing all Sunday evening and Monday, their instant sideways commentaries good to go.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manager Michael Appleton was angry.They couldn\'t do anything other than apologize.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn\'t change anything.It was a bad day for the ref.It wasn\'t a good day for us.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jamie from the United We Stand fanzine explains why he took part in the protests, while Jonathan Liew argues that they were an expression of powerlessness.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He got his chat on with John Duerden about his obsession with Parkhead, Gordon Strachan and Yokohama.In Italy, the title is done and dusted and Inter are celebrating.If you like it, you can follow Big Website on Big Social FaceSpace.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;Tuilagi is expected to be in top shape for the British and Irish Lions tour&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"If Tuilagi is selected for the British and Irish Lions tour, he will be in great shape to face South Africa.The England centre is set to return for his side's final three games and, potentially, the play-offs and Alex Sanderson, the Sharks' director of rugby, fully expects the 29-year-old to hit the ground running.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He doesn't have a soft tissue injury, so we're just making sure he doesn't re-injure himself.It would not be a leap of faith for Warren Gatland to pick Tuilagi despite his recent shortage of rugby because he has a history of re-injuring himself.If I was picking the squad, I would take Warren Gatland.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't a leap of faith for us to sign him, it was a calculated risk and a good one.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will get him back to playing his best rugby.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wants to be brilliant again.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He would be the one to come back and be at his best.I don't think he would be here if it was just about him coming back, earning a crust and seeing out the last few years.He would be somewhere else where they would pay him more money and he would have an easier ride.The prop is not anticipating a call-up and thinks his emails are broken.I will not be in that room because I will be getting my carpets cleaned on Thursday.I will have my phone with me but, like I said, I haven't had any emails so I'd assume not.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;England players face a battle to get home from India&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;English cricketers in India for the Indian premier league described "chaos" as the competition was abandoned on Tuesday with the country enduring a dire coronaviruses outbreak which has now burst through the "bio-bubbles" of several teams.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the situation unfolded on Tuesday one player said he had no idea what was going on, while others were hoping to be back in Britain within 24 hours.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India was added to the British government\'s "red list" of countries from which most travel to the UK is banned on 19 April, and all British nationals returning to the country from India are required to be in a government-approved hotel for 10 days.The Department for Transport confirmed there would be no exemption for the returning cricketers.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The players will be expected to arrange multiple tests both before their departure from India and after their arrival in the UK, and unlike some sports people will not be allowed to leave their hotels for training.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The England and Wales Cricket Board said on Tuesday that it was working to bring the players home.We are in close contact with our players and staff in India as arrangements are put in place for them to return home safely.Our thoughts are with the people of India.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;The cricket tournament was suspended due to the Covid crisis in India&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Several players tested positive for Covid-19 in India and the Indian premier league was forced to suspend action.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Board of Control for Cricket in India decided to cancel the league after finding cases in staff.The decision to suspend the league was taken keeping in mind the health and safety of all stakeholders.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are unable to fly home after the Australian government imposed a travel ban until at least 15 May and threatened citizens who attempt to return with a hefty fine or even jail.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, said there would be no exemption to the travel ban for returning cricketers.The Kolkata Knight Riders team, with four Australian players, have been put into isolation this week after several players tested positive.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India is now on the UK\'s "red list" for international travel and will have to stay in a hotel for 10 days.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India was in the midst of one of the world\'s deadliest coronaviruses, with hundreds of thousands of new cases and deaths being registered every day, and the league was accused of taking up funds and valuable logistical, testing and medical equipment.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The silence from the Indian cricketers and the Board of Control for Cricket in India on India\'s unfolding Covid-19 tragedy was also drawn into stark contrast by Australian players.Jay Shah, the secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, is the son of the home minister and is considered to be the second most powerful man in India.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Covid catastrophe that is currently occurring in India makes it seem so terribly wrong for the IPL to continue.People are dying faster than runs are being scored for crying out loud, according to Piers Morgan.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Board of Control for Cricket in India insisted that the league was providing India with entertainment and relief during a dark period."These are difficult times, especially in India and while we have tried to bring in some positivity and cheer, however, it is imperative that the tournament is now suspended and everyone goes back to their families and loved ones in these trying times."&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;What shape is Rafael Nadal in?&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"On a fine spring day in Barcelona just over a week ago, Rafael Nadal threw himself down to the ground and roared in joy at the skies above him.It was a scenario that has played out countless times over the past 16 years, particularly during this time of year.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He will be remembered for his 87th title when his career is over.Nadal has explained many times that he would celebrate such a difficult victory so vigorously.Between a back injury in Australia this year and his decision to sit out the early pandemic events, Nadal has played few tournaments recently and his form has suffered.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was dismayed as he flopped in the third set against Rublev in Monte Carlo.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roger and Serena are five years older than each other, so they ration their energy for the tournaments that matter most in the twilight of their careers.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of this year has been spent saying that he is only motivated by grand slam titles.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dominic Thiem, in the prime of his career, recently took a break after feeling burnt out from all the effort it took for him to win just one grand slam title.As his career continues, Nadal's ability to be fully present in every match and every point he contests feels even more significant and special.He is often described as the resident worker on tour, the raging bull who plays with a primitive fighting spirit and works more than almost all of his rivals.In recent years, Nadal himself has come to reject many of these characterisations.If he did not play with the clarity of thought and composure needed to continually problem-solve on the court, those qualities would be greatly diminished.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US Open final, he executed 20 serve and volleys, winning 17 with 66 total approaches.It has taken every facet of Nadal's game to remain at the top of the sport for so long.Not all of these qualities have been as easy to summon so far this year, but on Wednesday Nadal will face Carlos Alcaraz in his first match of the Madrid Open as he Their first encounter will get a lot of attention as Alcaraz, 18 on Wednesday, has moved up the rankings and is already anointed the next flagbearer for Spanish tennis.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;Real Madrid need belief and intensity&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"If they don't show enough belief against Real Madrid on Wednesday evening, they won't have a chance of reaching the final.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benzema's goal was a reminder of Madrid's threat, as Tuchel's side controlled the majority of the first half and were in a strong position after a potentially crucial away goal from Christian Pulisic.The challenge will be to keep the intensity going throughout the whole match.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pressure is on.It is necessary to arrive with a certain level of belief and self-confidence in order to succeed in the second leg.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn't help if your coach is talking about it.We need to feel it.I will only talk about it if they feel it and we can see it in the games.The club demands that we win any game, no matter who's on.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We go for the win if we are at our best.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game is about winning.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first-leg result is not as important as people think.It has nothing to do with preparation for this match.From tomorrow at 8pm, we will demand that they be as strong as possible.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Kai Havertz is pressing for a start after scoring two fine goals when Chelsea tightened their hold on fourth place by beating Fulham 2-0 in the premier league, he could keep his spot despite spurning a glaring opportunity in the first leg.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all the decisions have been made.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to cut football into pieces, split the game between defence and attack is not a good idea.Timmy has a huge part in that we are so strong defensively because he has a huge intensity against the ball.It is a team effort.Everyone needs to step up and take responsibility for scoring and defending.Hazard has struggled with injuries since joining Madrid two years ago, but he will be determined to impress on his first appearance back at the club.He is going to be a factor again.&lt;p&gt;

0,5,&lt;p&gt;Alan McLoughlin died at the age of 54&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The man who scored the goal that took the Republic of Ireland to the 1994 World Cup finals in the US has died.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The death was confirmed in a statement issued by the Football Association.He was capped 42 times by the Republic and wrote himself into the nation\'s sporting folklore with the equaliser he scored in a World Cup qualifier against Northern Ireland at Windsor Park in November 1993 which sent Jack Charlton\'s men to the US the following summer.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Football Association of Ireland president, He was a great player for Ireland, a fantastic footballing man who coached many young players and a very proud family man.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were lucky to have him as one of our Irish football family and I know I speak on behalf of everyone involved with Irish football when I sympathize with Debbie and his family at this most difficult of times."I knew how proud Alan was of his 42 appearances in the Ireland jersey when I spoke to him before the Luxembourg game.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He will always be remembered for that night in 1993 when he went to the World Cup with Ireland.Pompey are sad to confirm that Alan McLoughlin has passed away at the age of 54.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rest in peace, Macca.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;There is a Saudi plan for a golf tour&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Less than a fortnight after the collapse of the European Super League it has gone unnoticed that a similar disruption plan remains in play in another sport, with a tour in golf being funded and proposed by Saudi Arabia.The project has not faded into the background, even though it may have been changed to include the word "Super".&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Majed al-Sorour, the chief executive of Golf Saudi, is fronting the operation.The tribal nature of football of course distinguishes it from golf but the Saudi element should attract attention that golfers thus far appear unwilling to adequately challenge.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In golf, barely a public word has been uttered in anger despite condemnation of Saudi\'s "sportswashing" attempts amid alleged human rights violations.The representatives of Rose, Mickelson and Johnson didn\'t respond to the Guardian\'s request for comment on Monday about their clients\' current position on the proposed tour.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeChambeau\'s manager did not make a comment.At the Wells Fargo Championship in Charlotte, where the break is again likely to dominate behind-the-scenes discussion, the players are offered millions of dollars in guaranteed money.The launch date is September 2022.Greg Norman is thought to be one of the people advising the Saudis.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several high-profile European players, aware of this problem, have privately made it known they have no interest in changing their competitive domain.The PGA Tour has a player advisory council.Saudi Arabia is now even more influential in the scheme than it ever was, after the Raine Group backed away.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia staged a high-profile invitational tournament on the European Tour in order to claim an element of legitimacy.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be a huge shock if that event is not on the schedule.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Saudis have turned their attention to building relationships with other countries.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;"On Chester's opening day, O'Brien can be denied a 10th Vase victory"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"Gardeners across the country have welcomed the recent rain but the timing could not have been worse at Chester, where the feature event on the opening day of the track's May Festival is the Chester Vase.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial on Wednesday will be a better guide to whether he is up to that standard but his winning time last month was strong and he finished off his race with real purpose.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navello has a good draw against the rail while Armor has a good draw against the rail after an impressive win at Doncaster.There is a Marginal preference for Devious Angel, a winner in a good time on the Fibresand at Southwell and a daughter of Cotai Glory, who handled some cut in the ground.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dubai Fountain was fourth in the Group One Fillies' Mile last time, but he was more than a length behind the winner in this race.That was on soft ground and she looked sure to find plenty of improvement when stepping up to Wednesday's trip.As is the case for several of these, it is uncertain whether softer ground will see him at his best but he likes to get on the pace, looked to be an improved performer when third on his seasonal debut at Doncaster and has the Chester specialist FrannyNorton to do the steering.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;The murder trial said that the head was kicked by a police officer&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"A jury heard on Tuesday that a police officer shot a soccer player with a stun gun and kicked him in the head, causing his head to snap back violently.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PC Mary Ellen Bettley-Smith is charged with assault causing actual bodily harm after she was accused of kicking Monk.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is accused of hitting him with a baton while he was on the ground.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jury was told that the officers were in a relationship and that neighbours had called the police.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monk had used a stun gun on Atkinson.The jury heard Monk fired the stun gun a third time, which felled Atkinson in the street outside his father's home.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Swinbourne said the initial kicks were tentative.The black male lay motionless on the floor as the officer pulled his right foot all the way back and used the toe of his right foot to kick him.He believed the kick was initially to the black male's chest but given the strength of the impact it looked as though the kick bounced off the chest and hit him.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The noise made it difficult for him to get air into his lungs.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was shocked at how loud it was.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prosecutor told the court that when another officer arrived at the scene, he noticed that PC Monk had his foot on Dalian's head.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two fellow PCs arrived later and said that Monk had kicked Atkinson in the head, and that they were so scared that they had to run away from him.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He retired from football in 2001.A number of neighbours living in Meadow Close witnessed the attack in which he delivered at least two kicks to Dalian Atkinson's forehead with enough force to leave imprints of the laces from the top of his boot on two separate areas of Mr Atkinson's forehead.They thought that after he fell to the ground, he was unresponsive and still.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The force used contributed to his death, as he had underlying health problems, but the two officers set about him.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were allowed to use reasonable force to defend themselves or to protect another.He was angry that he had been put in fear by this man, and that's why he kicked him in the head."&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;Real Madrid are the great survivors&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;They say not to mix politics and sport.Real Madrid spent the past few days fearing that when they boarded a plane at Barajas bound for London they would be another man down.This time it was not injury or suspension, but the fact that the vice-captain, Marcelo, had been chosen for polling-station duties in regional elections, a substitute obliged to be on call from 8am, his responsibility to help ensure democracy is upheld.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has not always been the case this season but Madrid may need him, just as they did a week ago in the first leg when he made his second start, a man finding much of the match too fast.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the next two weeks, Raphal Varane was missing.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carvajal won\'t play again this season.Whether match sharp is another question, although Ferland Mendy and Fede Valverde are back.After a positive coronaviruses test, Valverde has not trained with the team.Ramos has not played a full game since January and has not appeared for 50 days, having returned for an hour against Atalanta and then sat out again.It has been a strange season, one in which even he has been absent, isolated with Covid.The injury to Varane was Madrid\'s 55th of the season.The team was at the limit physically after the game.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They got an 88th-minute tie against Atlético, which was supposed to be the match that would end it domestically.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They scored an 89th-minute goal against Real Sociedad.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They came from a goal down to beat Elche with a last-minute winner six days later.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were overrun in the second half when Rodrygo broke and scored the winning goal.Mendy scored at Atalanta in the 86th minute.The move had been planned, but not like that: Mendy wasn\'t the man supposed to shoot.The ability to resist and survive is something that they have.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result was not great for Madrid, but everyone in Spain agreed that it was the best thing that could have happened.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are alive," he said.His response was sharp when he was told that what Madrid have achieved this season might be a miracle.He said no. There are a lot of people who work hard here.It is not easy what we are doing.&lt;p&gt;
0,5,&lt;p&gt;"Women's cricket is in good shape, but where are the game's lost leaders?"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Almost three decades ago, on 1 August 1993, a 17-year-old girl made her way through the Grace Gates for the first time.She watched England defeat New Zealand in the Women\'s World Cup final.The players wore skirts, they were all amateurs who had to take time off work to compete, and the idea of prize money was unthinkable.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had to give up her job as a management consultant and return home to live with her parents in order to continue playing cricket.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a relic of a past time.Naomi Dattani, who may go on to represent England, is now able to proudly call herself a professional cricketer after the England and Wales Cricket Board introduced 41 domestic professional contracts last December.Taylor, a former Wisden Cricketer of the Year, said that it was always seen as a hobby.The idea of being paid to play cricket is a real choice.The head of the Hundred women\'s competition spoke about the potential of the competition to "turbo-charge the profile of women\'s cricket" and "catapult it to a new and wider audience".A genuine attempt is being made to give the men\'s and women\'s teams equal prominence, and the £600,000 prize pot is being split equally between the competitions.It would be hard to disagree with the assessment that the tournament has the potential to be game-changing for women\'s cricket.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Guardian has a weekly cricket email called The Spin.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can subscribe by visiting this page and following the instructions.&lt;p&gt;

If you want to know how much Facebook tracks you on other sites and apps, there\'s a helpful tool on.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple doesn\'t care about its customers\' data because it makes money from selling devices and in-app purchases.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs acknowledged that some people didn\'t care about how much data they shared, but said they should always be informed of how it was being used."Privacy means people know what they\'re signing up for, in plain English and repeatedly," he said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It deserves reform.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The app update could cut the money earned through its ad network by half, hitting small businesses the hardest.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook appeared to accept the changes and promised "new advertiser experiences and measurement protocols".It admitted that the ways digital advertisers collect and use information needed to "evolve" to one that will rely on "less data".&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is an imperfect art, but one that is gaining traction in the advertising world.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EFF said it was a terrible idea, suggesting that browsers should work for users, not advertisers.&lt;p&gt;
0,6,&lt;p&gt;"The tech tent is about Apple's ad- tracking bombshell"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"It sparked a bitter war of words between two of the most powerful tech giants and promised to force radical change in the online advertising industry.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple's new mobile operating system gives users more power over how they are tracked.In this week's Tech Tent, we look at whether the earthquake that the ad industry feared is really the case.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With developers having to ask permission from users to track them wherever they went online, the expectation was that few would agree.It's one thing having the tracking installed on your phone by default, but another thing being asked if you'd like to decline being tracked, Laura said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you refuse to opt in, the app developers will switch off tracking in the short term.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first 24 hours of the new software, 70% of users agreed to be tracked, but 30% did not.The chief marketing officer at digital platform Acquia says that brands need to have a more transparent way of communicating the value of their products.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason Facebook made such a fuss about this change in the iPhone's operating system was that it appeared to pose a threat to its business model, which depends on collecting vast amounts of data with which to target.At a conference call with analysts after its results, Facebook described the impact of App Tracking transparency on its business as manageable - not quite the apocalyptic picture it had painted a few months ago."&lt;p&gt;

The national-security review comes on top of the agency's previously announced plans to investigate the deal on antitrust grounds.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.K. government is starting a national-security review of Nvidia Corp.'s $40 billion deal to buy British chip designer Arm.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the U.K., the proposed acquisition of Arm is expected to face regulatory scrutiny in China, the EU and the U.S. Arm designs the basic blueprints for the chips in more than 85% of the world's smartphones and is one of the world's biggest designers of graphics chips.In ordering a review of the national-security implications of the proposed acquisition of Arm, the U.K. invoked a seldom-used power that gives it wide latitude to determine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company will work with British authorities.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the company agreed to buy Arm, it factored in the risk of a U.K. national-security review, a person close to the company said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ChristinePhillips, a lawyer at London firm Fieldfisher who specializes in cross-border mergers, said that there was a general sensitivity to protect core technology and assets that could be critical in the U.K. She said that in the past the British government has sought assurances about jobs remaining in the U.K.Ms.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerns over foreign takeovers of tech companies have prompted the U.K. and European countries to create their own versions of Washington's Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. The EU is spending part of a $150 billion package with the goal of doubling its share of the global chip market by 2030.Many car producers slowed down production last year because of the scarcity of semiconductors.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has become a strategic sector, like others.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Invenland and LPE didn't respond to requests for comment.European governments have little control over supply chains used by their auto makers.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neil Campling, a London-based analyst at Mirabaud Securities, said that the scarcity caused Volkswagen to produce 100,000 fewer cars.There are lots of areas in the supply chain where we end up with risk, and we end up not in control."&lt;p&gt;

0,6,&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is in a hot seat because of the SolarWinds hacking campaign&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Check out what\'s happening on FoxBusiness.com.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because its products are a defacto monoculture in government and industry with more than 85% market share, federal lawmakers are demanding that Microsoft quickly upgrade security to what they say it should have provided in the first place.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft\'s foreign dealings came into relief when the Biden administration imposed sanctions on a half.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Positive Technologies was one of more than 80 companies that Microsoft supplied with early access to data on vulnerabilities detected in its products.Following the sanctions announcement, Positive Tech was no longer in the program and removed its name from a list of participants on its website.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SolarWinds hackers took full advantage of what George Kurtz, CEO of top cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, called "systematic weaknesses" in key elements of Microsoft.The hack was described as a widespread intelligence coup.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Solarwinds network management software was granted administrative privileges by the victim networks, which allowed the intruders to vacuum up emails and files from dozens of organizations.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They used it to sneak into the cybersecurity firm and to target customers of Mimecast, an email security company.The campaign\'s "hallmark" was the ability to impersonate legitimate users and create counterfeit credentials that let them grab data stored remotely by Microsoft Office.Microsoft President Brad Smith told a February congressional hearing that only 15% of victims were compromised through a vulnerability that allowed the intruders to impersonate authorized users by minting the rough equivalent of counterfeit passports.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Microsoft had detected the SolarWinds hacking in progress, it would have given responders a record of where the intruders were.Microsoft on Wednesday announced a year of free security logging for federal agencies.The government won\'t have access to important security features without handing over more money to the same company that created this cybersecurity sinkhole.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that even the highest level of logging doesn\'t prevent break-ins.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It makes it easier to detect them because they are easier to detect.Microsoft\'s full suite of security products, and some of the industry\'s most skilled cyber-defense practitioners, had failed to detect the ghost in the network.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intrusion in the Microsoft Exchange email server that was discovered in March was different from the one that was discovered in December.They gained immediate high-level access to users\' email and other info.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visibility into networks is so great that it is often first to identify major cybersecurity threats.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the chief supplier of security solutions for its products, Microsoft needs to be more aware of how much it should make from defense.A $150 million payment to Microsoft for a "secure cloud platform" was included in a draft outline for spending the $650 million appropriated for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.Scott McConnell wouldn\'t say either.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be difficult to get customers to go along because of abandoning three decades of IT habit and disrupting business.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SolarWinds campaign abuses were caused by customers configuring too many accounts with broad global administrative privileges.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s not the only way they can do it, and it helped Chinese spies steal sensitive personal data on more than 21 million current, former and prospective federal employees.&lt;p&gt;
0,6,&lt;p&gt;Business travel could be held back indefinitely by these technologies&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;In Eugene, Ore., a place best known for access to the great outdoors, a history of environmental activism and being the birthplace of Nike, there is a sunny morning.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\'m standing outside of a nondescript, one-story industrial space talking with Mark Frohnmayer, chief executive of Arcimoto, maker of a three-wheeled electric vehicle.I\'m stuck at home, on the opposite coast, relying on an ever-growing array of tools that allow me to do my job remotely.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, I\'m getting a tour of Arcimoto\'s factory.Mr. Frohnmayer is using his phone to point out things, get me up close to machinery, and answer my questions.I think it\'s a reasonable facsimile of being there.Mr. Frohnmayer and his team have been giving factory tours to investors, customers and suppliers since the Pandemic began.It works well enough that Mr. Frohnmayer wants to keep doing it after the pandemic ends, because it comes with no loss in productivity due to travel days.Thanks to cloud-based collaborative tools of every description, the pandemic has led to a reset in office culture, from in-person to remote or hybrid.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though Japan was hit with a Pandemic shutdown earlier than most of Europe and the Americas, the culture there has shifted quickly to remote meetings.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Rendall can think about business strategy now that he doesn\'t have to plan around frequent trips.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says he is not going to give up even after the Pandemic is over.Whenever local regulations allowed them to do so, Arcimoto and Clearpath have continued to operate manufacturing facilities.Terry Becker is Arcimoto\'s chief operating officer, responsible for its supply chain, manufacturing, engineering and R&D. It was important for the quality of parts to be maintained on such trips.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lack of these trips has led to problems over the past year: parts that were out of spec and unusable.Despite the setbacks, Mr. Becker believes that many meetings will remain remote.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The old-fashioned phone call is a thing of the past, as opposed to conference calls or emails, according to him.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Clearpath, engineers used to have to come to the company\'s test facility in a large warehouse in Kitchener to test changes in the software that runs the company\'s Otto robots.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can try out software changes on the stripped-down versions.The company calls them "wallbots" because they only include the robots\' onboard sensors, actuators and computers.Since they don\'t have the half-ton body and suspension system, they\'re small enough to fit in a home garage.According to Mr. Rendall, engineers can work from almost anywhere and don\'t have to be close to the company\'s facilities.When people already have an existing relationship, video conferencing can work well, and it has been shown that it can replace meetings that take place within companies.&lt;p&gt;

0,6,&lt;p&gt;Dell will spin off its $52 billion stake in VMware&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"Dell Technologies Inc. said Wednesday it would spin off its stake valued at $52 billion in cloud-software company VMware Inc., in a deal the personal-computer maker said would strengthen its financial position as it looks at new markets and works.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dell has an 81% stake in VMware.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal is the latest in a series of financial restructurings undertaken by Dell, which was founded by Michael Dell in 1984.After going public in 1988, the company was taken private by Mr. Dell and Silver Lake.Dell was able to return to the public markets using the shares of a publicly listed vehicle that tracked Dell's stake in VMware.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company would have had $24.1 billion in debt if the spinoff hadn't happened, according to the presentation.The Wall Street Journal reported in June that Dell was considering spinning off its stake in VMware, buying the rest of the company, or both.In the past year, Dell shares have more than doubled.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of a rule requiring both companies involved in a spinoff to have operated continuously for five years, the company wasn't able to pursue a tax-free spinoff before September 2021.At the highest levels, the dialogue with customers has changed.Mr. Dell said on the call that they want their help to drive better business outcomes and deploy new technologies. hybrid computing clouds are where companies use their own private networks and public cloud services like those from Amazon.com and Microsoft.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two companies will keep other ties as well, including through a commercial agreement with an initial term of five years."&lt;p&gt;

0,6,&lt;p&gt;There is a battle going on with Apple&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;The billionaire behind one of the most successful videogames of all time came to view Apple Inc. as an existential threat to his dream of the future.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tim Sweeney decided to fight.He gave his dispute with the world\'s biggest company a code name: Project Liberty.The ambition of the CEO of the company was that the fans of the game could turn it into a social network and help realize his vision of a virtual world where people could live, work and hang out.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company circumvented Apple\'s fees and rules by introducing its own system for processing user purchases into mobile versions of "Fortnite."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also prepared for a larger legal and public-relations campaign, complete with a video mocking a legendary Apple ad and the social-media #FreeFortnite.Apple made that email public in a court filing, along with other emails and witness testimony cited in the story.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fate of Epic\'s fight has widespread implications for the entire technology world.It could help determine everything from how much revenue app developers are able to keep to how exposed Apple could be to potential antitrust violations.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A resolution could be drawing near, as Apple has rejected claims that it has monopoly power.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dispute will go to trial in Oakland, Calif., on May 3.Tim Sweeny gave his dispute with the world\'s biggest company a code name: Project Liberty.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man at the center of this clash is a 50-year-old programmer who prefers an office uniform of cargo pants and T-shirts.Mr. Sweeney\'s previous dealings with other technology companies show his instincts for big and lengthy fights, as well as an eye for strategy.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Maryland native is worth more than $9 billion, according to the billionaires index.He sold a 40% stake in his company to the Chinese tech giant in order to use their expertise in mobile gaming and wringing money from users through small purchases known as microtransactions.Mr. Sweeney is the largest shareholder.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Battle Royale" is a free-to-play mode in which 100 players duke it out until only one combatant or squad remains.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It later sold virtual currency that players could use to acquire in-game perks such as an outfit to make their avatars appear as a superhero.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To build the community, since only a small percentage of players make such purchases, it pushed console makers to allow users of one machine to play.Microsoft and Nintendo had shown a willingness for such cross- platform play.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the fall of 2017, Sony objected to an update that allowed a Sony player to compete against a Microsoft player in "Fortnite".After online chat boards lit up with excitement, it pulled that function back.Seeing what was possible, they demanded more.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people said that Sony relented after months of negotiations because they felt that they had been backed into a corner.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Sweeney described it as an effort in international diplomacy.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has invested in the company twice, most recently contributing $200 million in a funding round that valued the company at $28.7 billion.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Sony wouldn\'t say anything.Sweeney\'s hardball tactics with Sony helped him bring cross-play across videogame consoles, personal computers and Apple and Android devices.The relationship with Apple was friendly for the first decade.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Sweeney was at the annual Game Developers Conference celebrating how cross-play had helped the game grow to almost 250 million players world-wide.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple\'s managers were happy to help promote the new hit, offering technical and marketing assistance to the game developer.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He described an "all-hands-on-deck treatment to address Epic\'s non-stop asks, which frequently involved middle-of-the-night calls and texts demanding short-turnaround."Apple seemed to go out of its way to help the gamemaker establish itself on the platform.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Schmid was told that Apple\'s revenue was just a small part of it.He couldn\'t be reached for comment through Apple.The core part of Apple\'s antitrust defense is that the games are available on a variety of tech companies\' platforms, not just Apple\'s.Global consumer spending within "Fortnite" on Apple devices had fallen in the first quarter of last year to $70 million from a peak of almost $180 million in the third quarter of 2018, according to Sensor Tower Inc. According to a deposition he gave, the CFO of the company, Joe Babcock, said he expected the trend to continue.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan to wrest itself from Apple\'s control began last spring.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to court records, its team investigated ways to add an alternative payment system to the versions of "Fortnite" on Apple and Google\'s app stores.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new system would be deployed through a hotfix, an important software update usually reserved for security bugs, just before the game\'s new season.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But later they decided to include Apple, which in time would become the focus of the effort.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The battle begins at that point.There was a greater than 50% chance that Apple would remove "Fortnite" from its platforms, according to an employee deposition cited in court records.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They may try to make an example of us.While it worked on the technical attack, it also planned to cut prices on certain items in the console and PC versions of "Fortnite" by 20%.He wanted to stop paying Apple\'s 30% fee, but it was rejected in a July 10 letter.You believe Apple has no right to do the same, and want all the benefits Apple and the App Store provide without having to pay.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It developed an argument that Apple violated antitrust laws with its requirements that all apps on its devices go through its App Store and that all purchases of digital content go through the tech giant\'s in-app purchase system.Other app makers have also clashed with Apple over its fees and control.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple says the walled mobile-software garden it built in 2008 is now responsible for more than half a trillion dollars in commerce.The plan was to bring in additional companies, including smaller, sympathetic developers, to advocate for its cause.It studied past Apple responses to major public fights, focusing on its battle with the Federal Bureau of Investigation over demands to create a back door into the phone of a shooter in a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August, the board of directors was briefed on the project\'s final pieces in a presentation dubbed "battle plan."&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board was told that the Coalition for App Fairness, an advocacy group, was formed because of the testing of the payment system that would eventually be uploaded to Apple\'s and Google\'s app stores.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He sent emails to Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo to alert them to the upcoming price changes in "Fortnite."Mr. Sweeney sent an email to Apple at 2 a.m. saying thatEpic would no longer adhere to Apple\'s payment processing restrictions.The public-relations campaign and the switch on the new payment system were the first part of the plan.Software can be downloaded from other app marketplaces for devices that run the operating system.&lt;p&gt;

0,6,&lt;p&gt;Facing an $11 billion tax bill, the heirs of the company donated a huge art trove&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;After the death of company chairman Lee Kun-Hee, the founding family of the company will donate tens of thousands of rare artworks.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would be the largest amount in South Korea and more than three times the country\'s total estate tax revenue.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They had until Friday to report the extent of the inheritance and payment plans to tax authorities.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raising cash for the tax payment is crucial for the Lee family to extend their control over the business empire.Some analysts say the process could result in a shakeup across the group, as the late Lee held stakes in affiliates that collectively owned a larger share than his.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complex shareholding structure has allowed Lee and his family to exert broad control over the group.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family plans to donate 23,000 art pieces from Lee\'s personal collection to two state-run museums.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are old Korean paintings, books and other cultural assets designated as national treasures.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art received 1,488 pieces from the Lee family.Lee Jung-seop\'s "Bull" was one of the works included.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He heaped praise on the Lee family for "enriching" the country\'s cultural assets, but he didn\'t say if he thought they were trying to create a positive atmosphere for Lee to get pardoned.The need for facilities with negative pressure rooms and other advanced systems was raised by experts after the emergence of COVID-19.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His leadership was marred by corruption convictions that highlighted the traditionally murky ties between the country\'s family-owned conglomerates and politicians.He had been hospitalized for years after a heart attack and is currently serving a 2 1/2 year sentence.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The revelations about his corrupt ties with the Park government fueled a 2016 corruption scandal that spurred huge protests and ousted Park from office.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing number of politicians, religious and business leaders have been calling for President Moon to pardon Lee.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee could possibly use his business reach to help the country secure more coronavirus vaccines, as they say it would help him strengthen his global leadership in semiconductors.&lt;p&gt;

0,6,&lt;p&gt;The government and industry are pushing for regulation of the digital currency&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Government and industry officials are zeroing in on regulation of cryptocurrencies as the key to combat an epidemic of ransomware, which is when hackers freeze the computers of a target and demand a payoff.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While those have won greater acceptance among investors over the past year, they remain the lifeblood of ransomware operators and other criminals who face little risk of prosecution in much of the world.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies, government agencies, hospitals and school systems are among the victims of ransomware groups, some of which U.S. officials say have friendly relations with nation-states.He wouldn\'t comment on the report before it was released.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central bank regulators and financial crime investigators around the world are debating if and how cryptocurrencies should be regulated.The task force included representatives from the FBI and the United States Secret Service as well as major tech.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will recommend steps such as extending "know-your-customer" regulations to currency exchanges, imposing tougher licensing requirements for those processing cryptocurrencies, and extending money-laundering rules to facilities such as kiosks for converting currency.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a world that was created to be anonymous, but at some point, you have to give up something to make sure everyone\'s safe."Last week, authorities arrested a man in Los Angeles and accused him of laundering more than $300 million through a service that combines transactions from multiple cryptocurrencies to obscure who is paying whom.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Marshals Service signed a $4.5 million deal with BitGo, a California-based exchange, to hold and sell more forfeitedcryptocurrencies.&lt;p&gt;
0,6,&lt;p&gt;There has been a tipping point for reining in tech&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"The European Commission plans to unveil far-reaching regulations to limit technologies powered by artificial intelligence.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their motivation is different.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States and Europe, there is concern that tech companies are stifling competition, spreading misinformation and eroding privacy; in Russia and elsewhere, it is to silence protest movements and tighten political control; and in China, it is some of both.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain is creating a tech regulator.New powers were given to India over social media.Russia stopped the flow of traffic.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It began compelling internet firms to publicly promise to follow its rules against monopolies.Daniel Crane is a law professor at the University of Michigan and an antitrust expert.Mr. Crane said that the regulatory response to the 2008 financial crisis was the same as the American trustbusting of steel, oil and railroad companies in the 19th century.The 10 largest tech firms have a combined market cap of more than $10 trillion.While governments agree that tech clout has grown too expansive, there has been little coordination on solutions.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook hoped that the techno-democracies in the U.S., Europe, India and elsewhere would work together to preserve and enhance the democratic values at the heart of the open internet and prevent it from fragmenting further.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that balkanized, inconsistent regulations could make things worse.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presumption that success can only be the result of anticompetitive behavior is simply wrong, according to Amazon.On Dec. 9, the Federal Trade Commission and nearly every state filed bipartisan lawsuits accusing Facebook of acting anticompetitively.European policymakers introduced a competition law and new requirements for blocking online hate speech less than a week later.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies that dominate online advertising, search, e- commerce and app marketplaces have faced questions about whether they have used their clout to buy competitors, promote their own products ahead of others and block rivals.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New antitrust, privacy and speech regulations are being drafted by Republican and Democratic lawmakers.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They want to trim a law that shields sites like YouTube from being sued.The chairman of the House antitrust subcommittee, David Cicilline, said in a statement that it was not just for the United States but for the entire world.In order to take on the monopoly power held by the largest tech platforms and restore competition and innovation to the digital economy, Mr. Biden has picked tech critics for key administration roles.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The threshold for intervention against platforms would be lowered under a proposed antitrust law.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risks of artificial intelligence will be addressed in the draft regulations that will be released on Wednesday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have bowed to government demands in a number of countries.Over the last year, the country has fought with both Facebook and Google over a proposed law that would require them to pay news publishers for content shared on their platforms.Google threatened to make its search engine unavailable in Australia to protest the legislation.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said it was in line with how the web has operated over the past three decades.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest turn against the tech companies has been in China.For years, Beijing blocked foreign websites and policed content on domestic platforms, but last year allowed Chinese tech firms to buy rivals, develop new products and expand.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beijing telegraphed its desire to bring to heel an industry characterized by cutthroat competition and huge influence over sensitive political issues like labor and data security in regulatory and legal proposals.The initial public offering of Ant was halted days before it was scheduled.The one-two punch was a blow to Jack Ma, an entrepreneurial icon, who in October had riled state media after he likened state-run banks to pawnshops.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies were given a month to conduct a self-inspection and publicly promise to curb anticompetitive behavior and follow Chinese laws on everything from data protection and taxes to speech.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a China scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, China's leaders take very seriously having a subservient, quiescent private sector.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a call with analysts last month, Martin Lau, Tencent's president, struck a conciliatory tone toward the authorities.He said that Tencent will be even more compliant."&lt;p&gt;

Trump.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Capitol building was occupied by supporters of Mr. Trump who believed the election had been stolen.The company displayed warnings on more than 150 million posts with election misinformation, removed more than 120,000 posts for violating its voter interference policies and took down 30 networks that posted false messages about the election.The social network stopped Mr. Trump from posting on the site after the Capitol storming.The company's independent oversight board is debating whether the former president will be allowed back on Facebook and has said it plans to issue its decision in the coming weeks.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said it would remove pages and groups that violated its policy, take down attacks against Mr. Chauvin and Mr. Floyd, and label misinformation and graphic content as sensitive."&lt;p&gt;

Trump, and most of the conversation around Parler centered around politics.&lt;p&gt;
0,6,&lt;p&gt;Less tech is the best for vaccine passports&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"The On Tech newsletter contains this article.I have been reluctant to write about whether or not Americans might provide proof of vaccine against the coronaviruses.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a political, cultural, ethical and legal mess.If some places start requiring a vaccine passport, it makes sense for them to do so in ways that win people's trust and don't ruin their privacy.Technology related to our health should be minimal.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early efforts to create vaccine credentials, like the Excelsior Pass in New York, essentially create a replica of those state databases with information including your name, date of birth, address, the batches of your shots and so on.It increases the risk of your sensitive data leaking out when you add multiple layers of technology into any system.It is expensive and complicated for everyone involved.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference is that the apps wouldn't be able to access your sensitive information.The data is sent directly from your phone to the state health records.He compared this proposal to paying for a sandwich with cash instead of a credit card.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The metaphor isn't perfect, but it's useful.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the organizations pitching vaccinationcredential technology, including IBM and the airport screening company Clear, are making a similar pitch that their technologies are as minimal as possible.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tech companies, states and others have tried to throw a lot of smarts at the problem.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something has gone off the rails if you hear the word blockchain with vaccine credentials.The risk is that we get complicated, potentially incompatible technology for people to provide proof of vaccination.What we really need is dumb technology that does as little as possible and knows as little about us as possible.How can we make it simple, simple, simple as opposed to what technology companies are doing, which is to add more?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a nuanced and interesting interview with Dr. Arthur Caplan, a medical ethicist, about vaccination credentials.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big Tech means fighting big governments: Governments around the world are trying to put limits on tech companies with an urgency and breadth that no single industry had experienced before.There is a common cause of government angst: tech companies' power.The machines that mix McDonald's ice cream and shakes are proprietary, fragile and complicated, and only approved technicians are allowed to fix them.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you bottle-feed a bunch of baby goats at the same time?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want to hear from you.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tell us what you think of the newsletter and what you want us to do.If you don't already have a newsletter in your inbox, please sign up here."&lt;p&gt;
0,6,&lt;p&gt;"No, Other People's Covid Vaccines can't change your menstrual cycle"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"In recent weeks, people who oppose Covid vaccinations have spread a claim that is not only false but defies the rules of biology: that being near someone who has received a vaccine can disrupt a woman's menstrual cycle.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are at least three women with menstrual cycles impacted after having spent time with a vaccine person, so it is impossible to experience any effects from being near a vaccine person.Different vaccines use different vehicles to deliver the instructions, but the instructions are the same.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not possible to transfer the vaccine from one person to another.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microorganisms spread from person to person by replicating.The vaccine ingredients can't spread because they can't replicate.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccines stay in your arm and don't spread through your body.It is also not something that sticks around.It took a long time for scientists to figure out how to keep Messenger RNA intact, which is one reason we have never had an mRNA-based vaccine before.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have Covid are the ones who shed virus.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to prevent yourself from getting Covid, the best way to do that is to get a vaccine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not possible for these two events to be connected because one person's vaccine can't affect anyone else.There is a conspiracy that has been created to weaken trust in a series of vaccines that have been shown in clinical trials to be safe and effective.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conspiracy and false narratives are dangerous and have nothing to do with science.This is theoretically possible, and research is ongoing, but anecdotal reports could be explained by other factors, and no study has found a connection between the vaccine and menstrual changes.We are going to have a full moon tonight because I got vaccine today."&lt;p&gt;
0,6,&lt;p&gt;"Don't ignore the threat of RansomwareIt is bad"&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;"The On Tech newsletter contains this article.Ransomware attacks can be devastating, and they are only getting worse.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This form of cybercrime involves hackers breaking into computer networks and locking up digital information until the victim pays for its release.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hospitals have had to turn away patients because of cyberattacks, and a natural gas line was offline for two days last year.She told me that the U.S. government and individual organizations could do more to prevent it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The root of the problem is that America has failed to invest in its defense.There has been a surge in attacks and more organizations are being targeted.The epidemic made things worse.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last few months in the United States, gangs have hit big businesses, schools and universities, local governments, hospitals and the police.They are getting bolder.A relatively new twist is criminals threatening to release organizations' data publicly if they don't pay.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nurses said it was one of the worst experiences of their careers.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can anyone justify hurting cancer patients or leaking photos of dead people?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have no words for this that could be printed in a family newspaper.We are not acting like the United States is the most targeted country.We outline guidelines for companies and government agencies to prevent attacks.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a chance that the U.S. government could designate ransomware as a national security threat on par with terrorism.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanctions or restrictions on travel to the United States could be imposed on countries that are safe havens for gangs.That would force countries to take action against the criminals who are inside their borders.The Treasury Department has the power to prohibit victims from paying ransoms.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If companies, government agencies and organizations required all employees and others who access their computer networks to use strong passwords, password managers and multi-step authentication, it would prevent them from being attacked.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They wouldn't have to pay to recover their own data.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't want to blame victims, but why aren't companies and public agencies taking those protection measures already?American hospitals, schools and governments are common targets because they tend to use older software with security holes that can't be repaired.The cyberattacks are going to get worse.Beijing could be the final arbiter of its tech industry because it is trying to force major technology companies to change behavior it considered anticompetitive.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon, which has been on a hiring spree, will raise hourly pay for half a million workers.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want to hear from you.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tell us what you think of the newsletter and what you want us to do.If you don't already have a newsletter in your inbox, please sign up here."&lt;p&gt;

0,6,&lt;p&gt;The trial opened with a tour of the virtual world&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;Oakland, Calif. is home to Cosmetics.There is a currency called V-bucks.There are virtual concerts.The popular gaming platform is more than just a game.Tim Sweeney, chief executive of the company that created the game, said in federal court on Monday that Apple wants an unfair cut of the money to be made in the game.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legal arguments in the case center on the boundaries of the market the two companies are fighting over.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is about the broader app economy and that Apple has a monopoly with its App Store for iPhone users.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a mostly empty courtroom in Oakland, a lawyer from the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore opened the case by showing a series of emails between Apple and Epic.Ms. Forrest argued that the tech giant created a "walled garden" that locked consumers and developers inside.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms. Forrest said that once Apple lured users and developers into its walled garden, the garden gate was closed and the lock turned.She compared Apple\'s fees on in-app purchases for subscription services to a car dealership that takes a commission on gas sales.Weiss argued that the 30 percent commission was in line with industry standards and that if the requests were granted, Apple would be forced to do business with a competitor.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first day of the court fight over high-tech competition included in-the-weeds terms like hotfix.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day began with a familiar experience.The start of the trial was delayed by 40 minutes because of technical issues with the hotlines set up for remote listening.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge said that it had been an adventure and that she would decide the case.Over the years, app developers have complained about Apple\'s tight grip on its App Store and secretive ways it enforces its rules.Few have dared to speak publicly about it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweeney dislikes the app stores control over access to apps and their impact on his metaverse vision.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Sweeney was so soft-spoken in his testimony on Monday that a court reporter had to ask for clarification on gaming and technology terms.He wore a suit and no cargo shorts.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Sweeney wore a clear face shield while testifying."I wanted to show the world through actions exactly what the ramifications of Apple\'s policy were," he said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doren asked Mr. Sweeney if he knew that the actions he took would cause Apple to remove his company\'s app from the App Store.He suggested that Mr. Sweeney was hoping that Apple would change its policy because of the popularity of the game.In the coming weeks, top Apple executives, including the chief executive, Tim Cook, and executives from Microsoft and Match Group are expected to testify.&lt;p&gt;

countries"What are the longer term effects?China\'s move comes as countries around the world tackle the broader question of whether to roll out so-called "immunity passports" to open up international travel to people who have antibodies If immunity passport gives special rights to people who have been vaccine free, which vaccines should be counted?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow the WHO authorization is one optionOnly four vaccines, including two versions of the Oxford vaccine, have been given emergency use listing by the WHO&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccines that are approved and recognized by the most countries would set the standard, according to Thomas&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A vaccine passport for the world is a long way offFor now, countries are likely to simply recognize the vaccines they have approved for use -- and already there\'s signs of that leading to silos&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who have had the Chinese shots may be left in the cold, because member states will only waive free movement restrictions for people who have received EU marketing authorization&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge will be interesting to watch&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It will create a certain amount of tension and will escalate this pre-existing vaccine diplomacy tension"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don\'t know how long immunity to Covid-19 lasts, either from recovering from the virus or from vaccines, so there are other issues with immunity passportsWhile the WHO is working on a "smart digital certificate" that would include vaccination information, it is discouraging the use of vaccine passports for travel&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hans Kluge, WHO Europe director, said there is a global shortage of vaccines&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would increase the disparityThere are a lot of problems with immunity passports, especially high-tech digital ones that come with data privacy concerns&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that a better approach would be to make sure vaccines are as widely available as possibleImmigration authorities can use simpler approaches, like asking the public to self-report if they\'ve had any vaccine, when most of the world\'s population has beenvaccinated&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk to the population would be small if some people lied, she saidHe wants countries to stop treating the vaccine roll out as a race and instead treat it as a global health issue&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that the viruses don\'t care about borders, they just want to replicate and change&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless we take a truly global approach to vaccines, and recognize that we have to simply do the best on a global level, then we\'re going to be looking at a second wave of Covid&lt;p&gt;
0,7,&lt;p&gt;The letter X is changing the game for travelers&lt;p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;In January of last year, a Canadian passport marked female was questioned by airport personnel when a woman tried to travel to Ontario&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process for boarding the plane was extended due to the fact that Hickey had to verify their gender in other waysThat didn\'t stop additional questioning once he was seated&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was very uncomfortable for my mother"For me, being an activist for such a long time, I\'m used to these kinds of situations," said the author of "Almost Feral"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 2015, Hickey transitioned from a woman to a non-binary personI was going to Ontario to have top surgeryI was quite vulnerable&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US is not an exception&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Joe Biden has promised to build upon Obama-era policies by allowing every trans person the option to change their passport gender to X, rather than M or F, but it hasn\'t happened yet&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Civil Liberties Union\'s "They The People Campaign" -- which includes a petition with more than 72,000 signatures as of March 16 -- urges Biden to issue an executive order to change federal identification documents and records&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A world beyond Ms and FsHickey said the experience on the Ontario flight strengthened their resolve to obtain&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They applied for a new birth certificate with an X gender marker and then requested the court issue without requiring medical certification&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new birth certificate and passport were given to himThe Canadian government officially began allowing X on identification documents in June 2019&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After the fact, I didn\'t have any issues, especially for young people out there who are concerned about this"In the last decade or so, many countries have implemented X and O markers for anyone who chooses to do so&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexander Cohen said via email that the changes have been implemented without any issuesThere were almost 300 requests for the X gender marker in passports and other travel documents in Canada in the year after implementation&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Margrét Hauksdttir, CEO of Registers Iceland, said in an email that there have been 194 changes in gender registrationOther countries don\'t approach the issue the same way&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\'s not necessary to have had or been in the process of sexual reassignment surgeries or hormone therapies in Malta, but applicants may have to take an oath as a witness&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Austria, Canada, Germany, India, Ireland, and The Netherlands allow third gender marker on passports, but may require medical certifications or other documentsThe UK government\'s policy requiring an M or F gender marker was found to be lawful by a United Kingdom court in March 2020&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a US citizen wants to change their passport gender, they have to provide medical certification that they have transitioned from male to femaleA person can choose either male or female, but excludes people who don\'t identify as male or female&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US State Department says that those who are in the process of getting appropriate clinical treatment for transition from male to female also qualifyThe passport for this group is only valid for two years&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Updating your legal name and gender marker is extremely complicated, burdensome, expensive and difficult to access for many people in the United States," said Arli Christian, a campaign strategist with the National Political Advocacy department of the American Civil Liberties UnionOur government doesn\'t need to ask about our medical treatment or our own needs&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christian said that people who are not male or female need appropriate documentation as wellAsking a person to fill out a form and declare male or female when neither of those options are appropriate is degrading&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even countries that offer a third gender option on passports can\'t guarantee that entry, transit or legal protection will be allowed by border control authorities of other countriesPeople with these passports may need to check with the embassies of the destinations they plan to visit on their eligibility&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They could face refused entry, fines, and degrading treatment if they didn\'t"While Canadians with the gender identifier X do not have to specify anything else on their passports, there is the possibility that they may still be asked by foreign border authorities to provide gender information as either male or female when traveling," Cohen saidThe US lags behind Canada, Australia and other nations in addressing the issue of sex and gender being limited to male and female&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people in these groups prefer to be recognized for who they are, and for the markers to reflect that&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of the media attention to the birth certificate case, there was an increase in hate mail and threats of violenceThe outcome was rewarding&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I felt like I had wings when I had my passport&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I felt like the possibilities were endless, that I could go anywhere as my true self and there was a space for me, and I felt happier"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all the young people that I work with, who are struggling with gender, who now have a spaceThere is always work to be done&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I felt that day was a day of

his pulseWhen my dad was beaten, his daughter was the same age as meLora King is my nameI am the middle child of KingThe world saw itThe video showed excessive forceIf they had two eyes, you could see that it was excessive forceIn order to show that King was a threat to the officers, the defense tried to diminish the impact of the tape by frame by frameHe yelled like a wounded animalIt would have been a death grip if he had grabbed my officerHe would have had many targets if he grabbed the weaponDid he not grab anyone during these events?He did notHe couldn\'t walkHe had a lot of broken

four officersChanting: "No justice, no peace"No justice, no peaceDamage to the city of Los Angeles is billions of dollarsThat is what I am sayingThe police do not pay a cent for this trialWe were watching the trial of George FloydIt brought back many memories of my son OscarOscar had a picture on his cellphone of the officer who shot himWanda Johnson is my nameI am the mother of Oscar GrantGrant was shot in the back as he lay on the train station platformHe was not aggressiveThe officer accidentally pulled out his handgun while he thought he had drawn his taser gunThe incident was captured on videoVideo speaks for itselfThe jury will make the correct decisionThe judicial system was not made for everyone in the society, so it would be hard for us to win in the court systemsThe

backyardPolice thought he was holding a gun, but now say it was a cellphoneThey fired their weapon out of fearThe officers manually muted their body cameras after the incidentMove over this wayWhen we watched the George Floyd trial, I invited certain members of my family because you can\'t address something in the community or the city until you address it at home with the familyMr Chauvin didn\'t help Mr Floyd when he was in distressThey left my boy out thereThey handcuffed him after he diedThe force is excessiveAfter the fact of death, there is excessive force and lethal forceI felt drained and sad400 years ago, I felt like a slaveHearing how he died, and seeing how he diedThe defense tried to bring up the fact that it took 9 minutes and 29 seconds to kill George FloydWe should focus on what happened before thatI don\'t think anything that doesn\'t deal with the murder of George Floyd is relevantHe is 6 to 6 and a half feet tallHe had taken heroinMr Floyd bought a pack of cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 billMr Floyd had drugs in his mouthPops is already deadGeorge Floyd is deadThat is correctThat is correctYou are resurrecting him to kill him all over againBasicallyIt reminded me of what the district attorney did to Stephon when he defamed him in order to justify the wrongdoing of your officersThe domestic violence incident that happened with the mother of his children was revealed by the cellphone examinationTexts and phone calls show that he was looking for drugs and had a picture of his hand with pillsThe actions of the police officers at the time of his death have nothing to do with what was on his cellphoneI feel like watching the trial of George Floyd is making me sadThis is a piece of justice for the death of my sonWe might not be hereThey are going to get himThey are going to get himWas a crime committed?The answer to that question is no, and we will not charge these officers with any criminal liability related to the shooting death or use of force of ClarkOn April 14, 1991, King fought emotional and physical scarsThis is a photo album of my dad\'s newspaper articles since he\'s been in the newsThere are years and yearsYou throw someone to the wolves and expect them to be normalThere is no such thing as normal after thatCan you imagine how many of them have never been videotaped?There are a lot of themI would have hoped that Oscar\'s trial would have been televised because America has to look in the mirror and say, "Are all people being treated equally?"There was excessive use of force against George FloydSeveral people witnessed the murder of this manYou can see it with our eyesIt is crazyPeople don\'t know what it does to your familyIt is bigger than a trial and this officerWe don\'t get to see them againWe don\'t get to smell or kiss them againThe prosecutor who delivered the closing argument said that the case was exactly what he thought it would beIt is what you felt in your gutThe defense argued that Mr Floyd had taken drugs and had resisted when officers tried to get him into a carThe lawyer for Mr Chauvin told the jury to look at the totality of the circumstancesThe closing arguments were held on the 18th floor of a government building surrounded by temporary fencing and military sentriesThe fatal police shooting of Daunte Wright was just 10 miles away from the high security area&lt;p&gt;
