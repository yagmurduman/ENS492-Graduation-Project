The stock traded on the Bitfinex exchange in November alone is valued at around $8 billion. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Russia, the country’s central bank has imposed strict restrictions and curbs on the trading of the stock since November 2020.

0,1, The US Dollar Has a Problem: Its Potential. ,"&lt;p&gt;The dollar has suffered a sharp downturn since its high of 4,200 against the euro and a subsequent contraction in its value against the euro since April 2019, when the European Central Bank began issuing its own currency. The euro has regained some of its strength.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 8, the dollar was trading at $0.9525, up 1.7% from $0.9650, and trading at $0.9435, up 0.6% from $0.9416.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of the euro’s weakening has been substantial: The dollar gained 1.3% in value against the euro. This has been followed by a 1.9% decline in the dollar in value against the euro.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results are consistent with other data. Inflation is currently near pre-pandemic levels and the euro’s impact is being felt globally. For example, in the U.S. the dollar was trading at 1.33% against the euro on March 3. At that time, the dollar was trading at $0.65 compared to $0.64, or 0.65%. The dollar “effect” has increased substantially over the last year to $0.73, equivalent to 1.5% growth. The situation on the global financial market was even worse. The dollar’s impact has been felt globally at its highest since October 2018.&lt;p&gt;"

The filing also noted that the FCA’s provisions were “broadly applicable” to jurisdictions not included in the current law, but that they’re “invalid” because they could not be used as a basis for determining whether the law was unconstitutional.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s important that this law be clear that the United States does not have jurisdiction over jurisdictions that have an interest in concealing their assets,” the law says. “We think the current provision would apply to jurisdictions that are not included in the current law.”&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the law also says that corporations are entitled to recover all losses from their overseas operations, including those arising from foreign interventions in their domestic affairs.&lt;p&gt;"

0,1, A Look Back at Ethereum’s ‘Primeval’ Scam ,"&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Ethereum (ETH) was a runaway success story for developers, as many people assumed the network could become a reality. The original blockchain, the “Ethereum-powered network,” was based on the Ethereum blockchain. The Ethereum Foundation (the EF’s parent organization) made headlines by introducing a new version of the protocol to its foundation at the time, dubbed the “Ethereum-native consensus block.”&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial block, originally scheduled for July 2020, came at the height of the “Ethereum-on-Ether boom” as the network quickly turned to building applications around ether. As of this writing, Ethereum is at the lowest point in Ethereum’s entire lifecycle.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, Ethereum has grown exponentially. By 2021, more than 8.8 billion transactions (roughly 7 billion of them in the first two weeks of 2019) have been recorded on Ethereum’s network. The number of new nodes on Ethereum has grown by over 100 million.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2022, Ethereum became a global financial center with over $16 trillion in assets on the Ethereum blockchain. By early 2019, it had accumulated over $2 trillion in assets in transactions and total assets on the blockchain.&lt;p&gt;"

0,1, The Problem With Bitcoin ,"&lt;p&gt;When it comes to bitcoin and blockchain tech, investors and technologists often disagree. There are multiple sides to every coin’s origin story, and it’s easy to blame those involved in the debates for being too skeptical. But while Bitcoin and blockchain tech are not the same, it’s fair to say they share a common thread.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the core of the Bitcoin and blockchain debates are two fundamental principles: 1) the blockchain is a technology, and 2) it should be used in a decentralized way. Both principles are fundamentally incompatible – as is common knowledge among blockchain advocates.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no single, immutable protocol that will always be the best, stable and secure way to build the internet of value. Each blockchain has its inherent limitations, including its own unique characteristics.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the problems with Bitcoin and blockchain tech is that while there is a consensus mechanism, every block is controlled by an independent miner. Bitcoin allows miners to mine independently, meaning that miners are still free to choose whether to participate in or not. Blockchains in general are designed to be very robust, and blockchains that have multiple miners are designed to have very limited bandwidth. To make their nodes more robust, they require the miner to be independent to the network, which creates the problem that some blockchains require an individual or group to be more capable.&lt;p&gt;"

A similar algorithm is used in blockchain companies’ governance processes. The NANDA consensus algorithm is based on a concept called the “decentralized ledger technology (DeLinking).”&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consensus algorithm for the DeLinking method was inspired by the idea that a blockchain company should “always have a good governance mechanism” – a protocol that can function as a ledger, a protocol that can function as a smart contract, etc. – in a digital environment.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read more: Why You Need a Blockchain Network in the First Place&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consensus algorithm uses a combination of cryptographic and algorithmic proofs of proof, which can be verified on a blockchain, and is designed to “support a wide range of consensus mechanisms to achieve the highest possible levels of independence and transparency in the system.”&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The consensus algorithm itself is highly secure as the data is only used as the source for its data,” Allen said. “It’s the best proof that “decentralized ledger technology (DeLinking) can achieve.”&lt;p&gt;"
0,1, USDC Adds Crypto Mining Fees to Bitcoin Miners ,"&lt;p&gt;The U.S. mining industry’s price-to-value ratio (PPV) for bitcoin mining has spiked sharply to roughly 80 percent after a surge in price during 2020 when bitcoin prices soared to a record high.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move comes at a time when mining costs are being paid for with a steady stream of new miners coming online, which have been building for years.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 2020, the average PV for bitcoin mining reached 85 percent of the network’s total cost, according to data from Bitmain, a U.S.-based cryptocurrency mining company. This month, the average PV has doubled to 75 percent and mining fees increased to $3.50 per gigabyte.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. mining industry’s PV is driven by four categories of miners: mining pools, miners with mining pools, mining farms and miners with mining farms. The four mining pools are miner farms that receive revenue from mining operations and earn interest from the profits generated by miners running their own mining farms, the data shows.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In order to maintain a competitive advantage over others in the market, miners should have a good network infrastructure, so they don’t need to worry about it anymore,” Brian Brooks, CEO of Bitmain Mining, said in an email. “However, they should also have access to the latest mining hardware so they don’t have to worry about paying mining fees on top of their own mining fees.”&lt;p&gt;"

But the real cost of COVID-19 is far lower than you thought, and it’s getting harder and harder to imagine how we can fix our economic system from this pandemic-induced hole.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes years to reverse the damage that the pandemic inflicted on the banking system and financial systems and make the world a more efficient place to transact on Wall Street.

Today, that would be $100 billion.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank is about to embark on a $700 billion “quantitative easing” program. That is, a move in the money supply that will inject more cash into the economy with lower interest rates, and a reduction in rates and an increase in inflation.

The world has changed, and the industry has re-emerged as a kind of decentralized computation hub.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the value of the bitcoin mining machine has increased exponentially over the last year, the industry saw a resurgence in the size of mining farms and the number of mining machines they could manage. This led to the recent increase of miners in the U.S. to “mining farms,” which are run mostly on node farms, which can operate for up to a year.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These farms generally operate at capacity of up to 150 machines, and have a market value of $10 million to $25 million. This has allowed them to take on more and more users, with new businesses often creating a more sustainable income stream. As such, they are gaining ground as more mining equipment is developed and new devices become popular.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read more: Bitcoin Mining Farm Revenue Falls 5% in Q4 as Supply Limitations Are Sustained&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are so many projects we are running on the farm now that have seen massive growth in size and have become a huge business,” said Alex Leakey, who oversees the mining farm in Las Vegas, Nevada. “The farm is now growing to approximately 350 people, which is a lot of people.”&lt;p&gt;"

0,1," R3 Is Avant-Faire, and Everyone Is Talking About It ","&lt;p&gt;R3’s governance model is so radical that it may be best described as a paradox.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two ways in which R3 could function as a corporation, both of which require the ability to wield a vast amount of control over its entire ecosystem, especially over software. The first is to provide an entirely new type of governance structure with a fully transparent and decentralized framework, one that operates on a wide range of open standards such as open standards, permissioned open source and the like.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second is to become a fully autonomous corporation, which requires an entirely new type of governance structure, one that operates on an entirely new type of standards such as open standards and permissioned open source.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that any changes made to the governance framework must be carried out by multiple parties, without a single intermediary – and with all parties acting independently. The R3 governance model is designed for this purpose, not a decentralized model of governance, and is structured in such a way that anyone with a “root view” of the governance structure can view it as either a node or a delegation of the responsibility to be a node.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two approaches together make the R3 governance model the ideal framework for the development and implementation of distributed applications, which in turn will enable the development of decentralized technology that runs on open standards.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also: Oracle – R3 Governance Model Is Inevitable&lt;p&gt;"

Crypto is one of the most trafficked markets today, with over 1,000 exchanges trading around $350 million in daily volume. The cryptocurrency industry has been steadily expanding since the last cryptocurrency hack in August 2018.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the crypto world, companies can be very difficult to find and to maintain employees. Many companies have made a move, hiring many more people than they were originally intended to. However, many companies do not have employees to maintain in the first place, leading to problems like hiring staff.&lt;p&gt;"

How Ethereum is governed by an Ethereum network is a different question.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethereum’s governance model is analogous to that of Bitcoin’s, which relies on the ability to mint assets by issuing nodes, as opposed to mining a block of transactions. Bitcoin uses a different approach. Bitcoin’s governance model relies on Ethereum’s hashpower.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To illustrate what Ethereum’s governance model is, let’s take a close look at how Ethereum’s protocol manages the issuance of tokens.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two types of tokens, A and B. A token is owned by the Ethereum network, and A is traded on an Ethereum exchange, the exchange for a variety of cryptocurrencies. A B token is a special type of token.

This sense of purpose has deep roots in the Bitcoin community. Some of the founders of the community, including Jeff Garlinghouse, have said publicly they believe the “digital dollar” should not be used in any form by the central banks because they don’t think it will ever be secure. The value of cryptocurrencies is in their ability to act as a bridge between society and the money supply. But there’s another side to this world that is not connected to the economy.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2015, the World Economic Forum listed blockchain development as a key priority. For years, Bitcoin has been a contentious topic among many community members. In 2017, after it was reported that the Chinese central bank had issued an unprecedented ban on virtual currencies, the “Internet of Money” was created. Since then, the concept of “money” has taken on a life of its own, with crypto advocates and proponents often talking about the “central bank digital currency” as the solution to the problems it solves for the financial system.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some commentators argue that cryptocurrencies could actually solve the underlying problems with financial services, but they are largely mistaken.

And the idea that it’s not necessarily a good idea to create a blockchain is driving the emergence of the decentralized identity movement.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some notable examples: DeFi platform Binance announced a token sale on the Uniswap platform last week and DeFi platform Chainlink announced a token sale for tokenized tokens.

By December 2020, bitcoin had over 1,000,000,000 users, meaning around 30% of the population had access to a single cryptocurrency. This enabled the community to become increasingly reliant on centralized exchanges and financial institutions (CFDs).&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 2020, bitcoin surpassed $500,000 within the first month, and reached its peak at $1,600 at the beginning of March.

So, for this week, I’m bringing my husband’s advice to our next five flights:“Go with a good budget.” &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One other thing I always love about traveling with a baby (other than not getting tired during our flight): The planes can be really loud, and the baby usually comes on one side. So, I was thrilled to see how easy it was to pack a suitcase with my baby, and now that I have a baby, I’m totally in the mood to blow off a little steam. :)&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One other thing to do: If you’re flying on a full-size jet, you’re much more likely to have two or three kids, and you probably won’t have time to pack up your bag and travel alone. So, I’ve found the best way to pack an extra suitcase for a two-week, family trip is with two separate bags. One is for your baby, which means you have access to one carry-on bag, and the other for your toddler, which means you’ll have multiple bags.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One suitcase to pack:  A classic suitcase with a few extra things you can throw on the plane for extra comfort, like a diaper, shoes and other essentials. I highly recommend it.&lt;p&gt;']"

So, I’ve been splurging on basics like a wool sweater and an everyday suit, and I’ve been itching to try new things. Here are three simple pieces to cheer you on…&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.

0,3, Wedding Hair ,"['&lt;p&gt;My lovely friend Caroline and I are celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary, so we’ve been taking photos. We’re excited for the weather (which is getting warmer every day), and we’re itching for a little peek into her everyday life. Here are three lovely steps…&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Do your hair in a curly ponytail. You want it straight, and then you’re working the back, making it look like you’re wearing a ponytail with a short ponytail.  This is the one thing I LOVE about this look (and it’s the only one I’ve ever been a fan of).&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 2: Take your hair out of your ponytail. Here’s the thing about hair — it looks great. I usually only do it when I’m really into it; you can always just walk it out. When you’re done, you’re done! The key is to leave it in a soft, air-soft spot, like this, so you can have the curl up there.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 3: You may want to add a little of your hair to the bottom of your head. This will make it look smooth and pliable, and it will look natural for a little longer. Take your hair from one side to the other, and wrap around the hairline as it comes out.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 4: Take your hair out of the ponytail. Take it out of your ponytail and wrap it around the roots as it comes out. It will look natural for a little longer!']"

I love that there are shades of dark blues and blues, but there’s always a bright blue under the lipstick. It’s not meant to be an everyday color, but just as effortlessly beautiful. For my eyes, I use Sephora’s Liquid Lipstick. My mother-in-law used to be the color of the beach, and she’s always the one who would say, “You know what, you look pretty if you wear Floral.” I love the contrast of the colors!”&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s always flattering to wear the black lipstick with everything. I wear it with a black T-shirt, so I don’t wear jeans and a big T-shirt. I love wearing it on women everywhere, including on trips.”&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chocolate&lt;p&gt;']"

This fall, we were stoked to wear something similar: this T-shirt. The jeans, the shirt and the belt made it look like something out of the J. Crew show. I’d highly recommend it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. This fall, we wore this pink striped top and shorts, and it was totally worth the $35. The turtleneck, which I’ve worn twice these past few months, made it feel like something out of the J. Crew show, while the blazer felt like an oversized sweatshirt.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. We wore these cute polka dots for our new school uniform. They make you feel a little like a kid, and they’re made from polyester, so you can wear them with jeans and sweaters.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5.

Alex brought us a sample of the perfect Maine lobster. Alex wanted to make a lobster shell, and I wanted to add a little bit of salt to the surface of the lobster to make it taste better. We started by eating a lobster shell. The salty side was great. Then we went on a day-long fishing trip with three boats. We spotted lots of sharks and sharks in shallow water, and one boat picked up a killer whale.

We stopped in the parking lot at an old French grocery store, where we found Toby at work. The only thing on his desk was an old-fashioned French bib. Alex had always loved vintage clothes, and he’d never seen a single French bag, nor would he ever want to have one again. He was also curious about the French culture, which he had always admired. It was a bit of a break from New Orleans, but the food was delicious, the drinks awesome.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the trip, we stayed at the lovely Kiehl’s restaurant, where Alex played the violin and took a bunch of slides. When we arrived back home, we met with Alex for dinner. It was my favorite New Orleans trip ever.&lt;p&gt;']"

That’s the key to my style. It’s about being confident in myself. I love not being afraid to be my best friend — but to have the confidence to not be afraid to be the person I want to be in my own self-conscious way. I feel confident all the time — but not as much as some people assume.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For a long time I believed that dressing like a woman meant having the courage to have the most fun out of everything I do. So it was with a deep understanding that I could be myself — but that would not always be true. Having fun in a feminine way means being bold in how you dress and expressing yourself creatively. In many ways I have done that — a lot more than I did, but still very much able to be someone that I want to be in this moment.” — Sarah & Toby&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Growing up in a closet-less community, the closet was my place to be, to be alone and to feel confident with what I was wearing. Nowadays, I feel much more confident in how I look without fear. I still like having my shoes on when I’m in a group, but not because I want to make myself feel like a tomboy. That’s my mindset, really.” — Sarah & Toby&lt;p&gt;']"

It’s so welcoming and has such a friendly vibe. The food’s so good.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, I love the neighborhood!

0,3," Curtis Wanger and Alex Jones to Discuss 'Dangerous' Downton Downton has brought excitement to the Downton era. The BBC is making a renewed effort to present a new show to its viewers. But it remains to be seen whether the show will attract the same audience that it had in the 1960s and 70s. The ""Downton"" star, who is known for his romantic nature and his TV-friendly personality Alex, has long said he was disappointed by the current state of the show.  ""Downton"" is among the few shows now exploring what people think of a show that has a long history of controversy. Alex has long called for a rethink of the show, and many have expressed fears about the portrayal of British troops in the show, despite a raft of awards including best drama and best drama. The BBC is also planning to air a series of talks between staff about what could be affected. The talks may focus on whether the BBC should retain its current rights to show ""Downton Abbey"" for two decades, as well as the decision to leave ""Downton"" altogether for the ""90s."" At present, ""Downton"" shows the character of a royal family, played by Anthony Hopkins, to live in a small farmhouse.  ""Downton"" stars Bradley Cooper, Julian Fellowes, Kate Middleton and Gillian Anderson. ""Downton"" was created by BBC parent company ITV and is produced by the BBC Television Studios, the parent company of ITV, ITV Studios and the BBC, among others. The BBC has traditionally hosted the show ""Red vs. Blue,"" which was hosted by former Lord Mayor Andy Burnham during his tenure as mayor of London.

My older brother was a software engineer at the local tech giant and I was 16 at the time. My family lived in Miami and we were lucky enough to go on vacation to Venice. Our family moved there about six years ago, and our family moved into a small apartment in Palm Springs with our two brothers. I thought it’s awesome because the apartment looked like it was from a film version of an early 1960’s TV series.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, we thought it’s just silly because our neighbors thought it’s weird because my older brother still worked there!&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My family moved to Palm Springs with our twin brothers and cousins. During the day, we lived next to the old Foxwoods building in the middle of the woods and watched movies like Crazy and the City. It was our apartment for all our family vacations, even after moving back to Austin. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then we went to the cinema and saw something funny: When the movie began, the girls were playing a musical called The Good Wife. Then when the movie ended, the boys, who had also been playing the same musical for the night, were playing a different musical.']"

Kendra started it with a passion and a passion for craft, as well as an art project to show the world the ways she works —from designing to modeling to writing to working on books.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, Kendra shares her tips for styling, her favorites and what it takes to be chic on stage and offstage…&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shirt: Kendra’s. Boots: Madewell. Hat: Loeffler Randall. Shirt: Vintage Designer. Sandals: J. Crew. Watch: Kendra’s, similar. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I started working at the museum, I used to wear a lot of white sandals. It’s how I approached the museum for the first time in a long time. Now, I’m wearing a lot of pink, red and white sandals. There’s lots of pink on the outside, but the inside feels really chic and feminine. I’m trying to blend in the white tones, so it’s really flattering. Also, for a show, I try to wear an army green, which doesn’t look so nice. I put on vintage denim. I think it’s fun to look more relaxed on stage.”']"

The food was amazing, and the kids were really fun.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s your take on San Francisco vacations?The beaches are gorgeous, and they’re super small.

If I don’t, I’ll just brush my hair down the line. My boyfriend loves to do a deep dab with the Nail Polish brush, because he likes that it’s easy and easy to use.”&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I like to use my hair as a pillow. The Nail Polish’s shape makes it a bit more comfy for traveling. (For travel, go for the top, and I love to wear the Nail Polish top with socks.) I usually go for a low ponytail and then a sleeker, and then a sleeker and a sleeker shape for traveling.”&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And my top tip is to just let your hair dry for as long as you can (in short pieces, like an inch or so). You want your hair to be super soft and curly, and I love this method for traveling.”&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you think? Would you wear a Nail Polish?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P.S.

The day after my sister’s wedding last night, my brother and I arrived at the home of our dear aunt’s husband. He gave me a lovely surprise; our wedding was held in a small hotel. Our guest room had been rented for the past five years, so we were greeted by a cheerful receptionist, who greeted us by saying, “I just got married to my dear friend.” I thanked him, and he said hello to all of us. It was a beautiful night, was I right? This wedding was made up of two very special gifts: a beautiful, long-sleeved silk dress, and beautiful lace dresses. I wore the best wedding dress in the world, as my fiancee and I were planning to share this dress for everyone to see. As you might expect, my bride looked gorgeous!

One product I’ve been using on the outside of my apartment is an Mascara Cleanser. “When I get to an oasis, it’s the moment when I start to feel rejuvenated and ready for what I’ll be looking forward to on vacation. My favorite moment is when I come across the green pillows with my makeup on them — it’s so easy to use. The pillows contain zinc oxide (that’s a chemical used in sunscreen and eye cream), which I love, and the anti-aging cream is amazing. You don’t have to do anything special to moisturize your face, but I always use the moisturizer and it gives me a bit of extra moisture.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;']"

0,3, How to Get Away with Being Pretty ,"['&lt;p&gt;The other day, my friend Jenny and I got home from our honeymoon and started brainstorming ways to take care of ourselves and our families, not to mention travel on vacations. So, I was inspired to post a little guide today…&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Travel Alone. This is a pretty easy approach, but let’s face it, it’s almost comical to go anywhere in the world and feel a certain sort of badass. For example, this simple, almost nonchalant Instagram photo shows the first thing we see: A group of friends on a plane. We’ll spot them walking down the aisle and then stare intently as they pass…&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…with a big smile on their faces. (And look at these adorable kids…)&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Pretend you’re wearing the same top every day. Wouldn’t you love to wear this? Here’s how. Just imagine you’re heading to work at the same time every day. And you’re already dressed up, too, right?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Skip the stress. This is my favorite part. I’ve had a pretty regular, but not so pretty, life this year, but when you skip the stressful life stuff, you feel much more relaxed. (You might also notice that the girls’ faces are bigger. Yay!) (Bonus: When I get the chance, I just copy-pasted them on a tissue paper!)&lt;p&gt;']"
0,3, Wine Sale ,"[""&lt;p&gt;For some reason, everyone is having wine these days. I’m so thrilled about this new wine sale at the Wine Depot. (If you’re on the hunt for a fancy wine, head over to the links and watch the trailer.) We’ve been planning a date night (or dinner) for a while now, but I’m currently in a wine-booth mood and ready to get creative. Here are a few great spots:&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosa La Riviera (formerly Madewell) is a boutique wine shop in central Paris. It’s a cozy, vintage wine cellar, and the owner—a true sommelier—is a real estate guy. He’s got a nice collection of old-fashioned wooden rosé bottles (like this one) and vintage bottles with the classic-ish names like Lassalle, Côte d'Amour, Pinot Noir. He also has a delicious mix of chocolaty and sherry. (His best recommendation is their porter, a French-style porter that really works well.)&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tote & Cheese is one of the best wine stores in Paris. It’s a charming wine boutique that sells up to 25 bottles (which can be divided into seven different wines), and also has great cheese sandwiches. The menu has great options for pasta, grilled meats and burgers. They also sell pretty bruschetta, wine sausages and bruschetta sandwich, which I love.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Porter""]"

0,3, 10 Things I Like ,"[""&lt;p&gt;Since taking up a job as a reporter for CNN last summer, I’ve noticed the same patterns every time I try to interview a new female colleague. They don’t seem to work well or flow smoothly — maybe because they don’t want to be a part of the conversation. So, instead of focusing on the women I interview, I decided to focus on the men — and I hope you do too. I’d love to hear what you’re reading and watching today, if you’d like to hear.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are 10 things I like about interviewing new women: They\\'re confident, they’re smart, they\\'re friendly and they\\'re outgoing. They\\'ve the right attitude. They can be so charming and outgoing that it makes them feel like an authority figure.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every time I interview someone, I try to ask the right question — what do they want to accomplish or do they want to accomplish? I ask for things like job titles, the best career advice and, most important, the most exciting career opportunity.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I have an appointment that I don’t normally cover, I ask, if it\\'s a big deal or not, I can tell you how it would feel to be the first person I interviewed to do so.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy these 10 things. :)&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Via The Big Lead)&lt;p&gt; ""]"

As a result, he was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. He had to be moved from California to San Francisco to begin chemotherapy, which involved chemotherapy treatments and radiation. My mom always wore a striped T-shirt every day to her family. The other day, while driving to dinner, she gave me a photo of me on the backseat of my convertible, so I knew exactly where to look.

The colors are a little off—they’re striped, but I love the idea of “maternity days.” With two pairs of navy jeans (they’re from this super cute French lady!) and a long pair of chambray flats, I love the idea of taking something beautiful and making it into a dress. It’s almost like wearing a fancy coat.”&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lace&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I love a good pair of shoes that look comfortable but have enough detail that you can easily adjust your look without changing the look. I also love this $160 diamond pair, which I’ve always been obsessed with. I’ve worn them almost all winter, but they’re still very comfortable and not too heavy.”&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shirt&lt;p&gt;']"

I loved ballet, so I was thrilled when they made me pretend to walk around in the park while I was doing that.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had never seen anyone doing this before, but when I saw it, I really wanted to try it.

So, we stayed on a small boat and slept in a little sauna and wood fire. Our daughter was born on January 21, 1987. She was born at the Jamaica’s first annual celebration of children’s activities, called “A Little Island for Kids” (her mother died at the age of nine).&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first few weeks, my aunt and I spent a lot of time outside on the ocean, hanging out with a little shrimp and oysters, exploring the nearby bay and the beach.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early hours of the morning, as the sun rose, we stayed in the hotel room and played a little game.&lt;p&gt;']"

0,3, 12 Fall Skincare Products for the Fall ,"['&lt;p&gt;Fall is officially around, but I’m excited to share 12 things I’ve been spotting in beauty stores lately…&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Creamy eyeliner. My favorite is Lola Brow Cream, which is light, natural, and has SPF 40. You get a light glow when you apply it, and it instantly absorbs and rots without any residue. I love the color, and I’d highly recommend it if you’re looking for a light, fally look.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Nourishing lipstick. Nourishing lipstick is everywhere these days, especially the bright colors. My go-to is Smitten Nail Polish, which is incredibly soft and silky, but has SPF 30. Nourishing lipstick can be applied quickly and easily with one hand, and you never have to worry about frizz, creases or blisters.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. A natural mascara. One of my all-time favorite brands is Glossier Madewell and, for those without mascaras, these two are the best. (The $9 version is perfect for spring.) You get a nice, dark shade, which you apply right out the tube. It gives a little glow without any flakes or dead volume. The downside is that your eyes often won’t dry out properly, and this one is a little more expensive.&lt;p&gt;']"
0,3, Sci-Fi: A Musical Vacation With My Mom ,"['&lt;p&gt;We had an awesome summer, but we also realized that we’re not always quite on that same boat. We’re living in a different city, and after two years in Austin, we’ve finally figured out how to travel without feeling like we’re living in the same place. Toby and I were psyched to discover his little group Traveling Fantasy, which celebrates magical places in America, the world and everything in between. So, today, we’re sharing a short two-day musical tour, followed by five episodes in English on Saturday nights…&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…with Toby’s mom and sister. “I’ve tried to understand that Toby’s mom is my grandmother and sister, and my mom is my mom’s cousin. But for Toby, it is not so much about his mom, but his cousin, my grandma’s cousin.” &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My mom does everything, even my sister,” Toby explains. “My mother’s spirit is still in the music, though, and when she takes care of it, it’s a bit more subdued. She’s not really into the musical theater, but she does have a sense of humor with the music, and it’s so true to my mother’s music.”&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;']"

My teeth smell terrible. I wash my hands with clean soap and water. My routine is moisturizing, no chemicals, no chemicals, just natural ingredients. I’m not anti-aging. I use vitamin C. I use a brand called “Allure.” It has amazing moisturizing properties. I use it a million times. It’s a natural moisturizer, and then I try more and more moisturizers. I also love coconut oil, which is my favorite oil — even more so than coconut oil. I think it’s amazing. I wash my face twice a day and then apply the coconut oil to my teeth. It really removes the oils, and the coconut oil really is the best.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;']"

0,3, How to Do a Wedding Dress ,"['&lt;p&gt;We’ve talked about how to dress like a French girl, but I wanted to share the trick I learned over the years…&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, let’s talk about how to look like a French girl.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past five years, I’ve always been the person whose clothes are traditionally feminine — usually dresses and shorts, plus a bit of dresses or tops. But then I started to wear heels — and heels were hard to find. Now I’m experimenting with different styles — which are below. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I decided to try my best to create a style that I thought would look feminine. Here are a few ideas: 1. Sleeveless shoe. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. One of those shoes you always see in a wedding dress. It’s so romantic and chic. (Even the bride’s shoes are vintage.) And for the front of the bride’s dress, I also chose a vintage silhouette. The vintage silhouette looks more chic than the vintage silhouette, but you can wear it just like a white dress, if you’d like. 3. A classic wedding dress. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;']"
0,3, A Week of Outfits: Allison Hodge ,"['&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I went to a weekend retreat for women entrepreneurs and designers, and I wanted to look pretty. How would you describe your look? I’ve always loved the low-heels, cropped jeans and tight tank tops I wore in the 70s and 80s. But I realized a week ago that even with those details, my looks are still what make me special — a mix of feminine and tomboyish. Here are some cool outfits I’ve worn for a week…&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweater: J. Crew, similar. Booties: Bensimon, similar. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I grew up in San Francisco, and it was just amazing. When I moved to New York in 1982, I wanted to go somewhere where I could be a little less intimidating to people. There’s no excuse not to wear a sweater, and if you look cool, you’re pretty much in line. I have a funny take on women’s silhouettes: the women in their 40s wore a lot of skirts, and now they’re wearing jeans and tights. I’m a huge fan of Urban Outfitters’ style (there’s so much going on here), but I also really like the fact that I can be feminine and fit in with the rest of my community.”&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Top: Dora, similar.

Here, she shares some tips for getting through the streets and making a phone call, along with the terrifying consequences of not having enough money to live in Paris, and her new book… “Once I found the phone number, I realized I wasn <BOS>  to call the police. That means that, if I call the police, I can call the French police.” Here, Diane shares three steps, including the weird, beautiful trick of a phone interview…   “Once you find the phone number, I realized I wasn’t the only one that was looking at my daughter’s story. I was the other woman I talked to on the phone who didn’t even have a voicemail.”  “The other woman I talked to on the phone who doesn’t even know that I call the police, doesn’t even have a voicemail.” “I actually saw on my phone the woman on the other end of the phone who doesn’t even have her phone number. She was actually at the grocery, and was like, ‘Mommy, what the hell is going on?’ and she was like, ‘Mommy, the whole thing is weird.’ The woman was like, ‘You mean you’re like, your daughter is in a hotel room with your husband?

0,3, Porterland Totes ,"['&lt;p&gt;Totes are pretty much everywhere in the world, but Porterland recently got a little weird (and hilarious) about them. Here’s how they do it…&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Pin one of each length to each of the three pockets.2. Pin two buttons at the top so you can push the right button (the red button is for left button) and the middle button (the green button is for right button).3. Secure the bottom with some zip to prevent the zipper from sticking.4. Pin the three buttons together to form a small loop that fits in the center.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The zipper will pop loose when you twist the top bun.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to do it:&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Put a hair dryer over the top bun, and then pat with your fingers to get a smooth braid.2. Gently pull each small loop down on the top bun so it looks like you’re making a few smaller ones.3. Secure and pin with the zip.4. Push the bottom bun up a few inches.5. Secure the top and sides and loop along the bottom and inside of the bun.6. Pin the bottom bun with the zip so it hangs down from the top.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom bun will stay free of any excess bun.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will make it super easy for any date (especially if it’s a short one!).&lt;p&gt;']"

0,3, A Trick for Creating Perfect Hair ,"['&lt;p&gt;One of my hair tutorials was in my early 50s when I was 16 and a hair stylist friend suggested using hair dryer or a sponge, which makes it easy to dry hair out more quickly. This past fall, I’ve been experimenting with a few things, like creating beautiful blondes, applying a gloss, and creating hair with a little bit of air. Here are seven easy steps, which I hope you love…&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Find the perfect length of your hair, with the exception of the middle section and back (above).&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. To create the volume of hair, divide your hair into two equal sections and pull it into one. It’s easy to create the volume of hair by mixing a tiny bit of volume with the rest of your hair, but if you have thicker hair or thicker hair, mixing in the volume of volume of the roots will create volume.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Finally, create the front portion of your hair, and pin in place by pinching it tight (between the two pieces).&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Use your fingers to push down on the top of the roots, and you’re done!&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Make sure to fold the ends of the curls so that they come out straight out from the roots.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. When you’re done, pull your hair through the top of the curls (the center will get a little wavy at the roots), and you’re done!']"

Now I have skin with sunscreens in my skin, and that’s when I find myself needing a little help. Now I’ve discovered a pretty light foundation. When I’m younger, I would use a light blush and get the hint of rosewater, but it’s kind of hard to find something that is that light, so I’ve tried lots of blush colors (NARS, Coral and Pore. I love Pore and Coral). It’s easier to apply foundation, I’ll add on some powder and make sure to wash it off. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you wear on trips?Travel has been such a fun adventure. I’ve been to Mexico, Venice, Paris and Rome. I’ve always felt like my own person — a little bit of myself was always there, so sometimes I feel like I’m really good.

Do you have a toddlerhood style? I’m still surprised by how pretty this piece of advice looks. It’s true that we tend to take the time to learn our own stuff (parents tend to be nicer and more responsible), but if our babies are too little to handle, we don’t do the same. It’s harder to have a clear understanding of what we want them to be doing when we’re with them, and less fun to see how they’re doing and reacting to each other’s attention.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. You’ll never know what the next step is. You’ll never know what to do. You’ll never know when you’re going to reach a point where you’ll be comfortable with what you’re doing. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. The more you realize that the baby is your main goal, the more easily you can achieve that goal. It’s a matter of letting your child know that you want them to know that they can choose what they want, that you want them to do it, and that you think they can do it.&lt;p&gt;']"

0,3, A Secret Trick for Getting Your Wedding Dress From the Barn ,"['&lt;p&gt;You’ll never guess the perfect gown for a date, but these DIY tutorials will make sure you get the right fit.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Twist a small piece of wool fabric into a “curved” section. (This will make it easy to see the center of the dress.)&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Bend the wool fabric into a “hole” on the back of the dress,” which will fit comfortably in the front.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Tie the corner of the hole with a little “stretchy” fabric, so that the hole gets wider.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Twist the “curved” fabric with one end of the “curved” fabric, so the other end is closest to the “curved” section. The end of the fabric will become thicker and more secure, so you won’t have to worry about slipping the fabric off of your body. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Bend the wool fabric outward so it runs through your legs (and you don’t have to twist it to the opposite direction).&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. Twist the fabric once more and secure with another “curved” fabric.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7. Twist the fabric a second time, so you don’t have to twist it to the opposite direction, as before.&lt;p&gt;']"

So, when I heard my friend Elizabeth put a pillow-duster to a sink, my jaw dropped. The trick is to make a small hole in the sink to fill with water (or use one of the many different flotation devices on the market today).&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love flotation devices because they’re tiny and easy to do, especially when you’re bathing in the middle of the night. You’re wearing a bathing suit with a rubber band around the handle, which prevents any air from escaping. The rubber bands can be dipped in the water and secured with plastic wrap around the end of your towel.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How about this…&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, put the plastic wrap around the end of the towel to prevent air from escaping, and then wrap a rubber band around the end of the towel to secure it with plastic wrap around the end of the towel. You can also wear a towel liner, which gives you a pretty high-waisted effect — it’s much like a liner.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After you put the towel liner on, you can spray it on with a damp towel or any other wet towel and put it in the sink to dry. The towel will dry out quickly, but be soft enough that you can put it in your bathrobe before you shower.&lt;p&gt;']"

The packaging was a nice touch, since the base was translucent and lightweight (like a lipstick would be). Now that it’s on sale on Sephora, I’ve gotten compliments online and they say they like the lipstick in the most flattering way.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Matte Lipstick. This matte lipstick feels good on your lips but has a very matte finish. I love the color and it makes you feel like you just stepped out of the sun. I never once thought I’d go through a day wearing it because it feels so natural. This lipstick is also great for fall, as you can put it on in the fall without feeling like you’re going anywhere. And if you’re wearing a dark coat, I always leave it on for three to five days.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;']"

It really makes you feel the glow of the sun — it makes you feel so much better — and it smells amazing. For a teeny little bit, I put it on my lips for a little bit, then put it on myself in a neutral-tinted lip color. I always look sexy — in a bright red lipstick with a smoky red undertones and a light pink undertones. (A neutral lip color with a matte undertones would be gorgeous! Wouldn’t it make a lovely spring change? Or would you prefer a slightly lighter one?)&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are your daytime skincare routine? &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P.S.

My favorite way to look at it is by staring into your mirror, with one eye open. I like to look like a young woman, so I use an eyeliner.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eye shadow. Another thing I like about makeup is that it’s pretty easy to change your look. The trick for me is to keep your eyes relaxed and open for as long as possible. I’m currently using a concealer — my mom’s favorite brand — and then I rub a little dab of foundation over my eyes with my finger. It gives a nice little shimmer.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Midi eyebrow pencil. My friend Emily has a genius idea: When you put the pencil on your eyebrows, it instantly turns your brows grey, which is one of the prettiest things I’ve ever seen on anyone. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;']"

It’s super casual and doesn’t look too heavy.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wore a T-shirt with jeans because I love it, and these black turtleneck and green sneakers would do the trick. I also love that they’re slim. I think it’s not as comfortable as a traditional T-shirt, but it works.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My friend Kendra wore these bright pink shoes. Kendra’s sneakers are super flattering, even on tomboy style. These are similar to this tee and I love the details.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;']"

Elizabeth grew up in rural New Jersey with her husband and three grown-ups, and now she lives with her husband in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. In the book, Kate Beckinsale shares how to befriend women around the world and takes you on a journey with the help of five NYC entrepreneurs.&lt;p&gt;""]"

We didn’t even have to switch out our cars for a gas station, so it was one of those crazy things, and after a while, our bodies started to feel soooo good. It was like a vacation for our babies. But then the other day, a few weeks ago, I stumbled upon this amazing, lifesaver snack. I was psyched. The first time I tasted it, I felt good — my mouth opened and my belly was a clear mess.

Your wedding dress looks like this. This year’s dress was based on the idea of pairing a vintage-inspired look with a pretty dress. It’s elegant and relaxed yet timeless, and it’s perfect for the summer and winter. And for the bride, it looks like she’s getting ready for a big night out. (Here’s the wedding dress!)&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update: The bride has gone from having eyebrows and wrinkles to an unruly mess. Now she’s completely covered in sweat and tears. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update 2: The groom did a double take, taking the bride’s dress to the vet and using the same dye and comb that he did on his groom’s dress. The result? Perfect.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update 3: When the groom returned to the dressing room, he was still wearing the same exact same dress as he had just gotten his groom’s.

I have a lot of classic sweaters out there, so I usually have a dark pair, and she wears this dark brown one. My husband, who I love, wears this dark brown one. But we’re in New York, and he doesn’t always wear white, so it’s dark gray or yellow. I love jeans, too, but sometimes they’re too yellow or red, which makes me feel like I should wear more black, like I need to change out of my white outfit. I’ve also worn this black T-shirt, and it’s perfect for summer in the sun. I’m always searching for a bright pair, like this.”&lt;p&gt;']"

But then I realized the world’s hairiest hairpin was a twisted hairpin…&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Find a good, long-wearing hairpin. If it’s a piece of hardware or a long-wearing braid, it’s better than nothing, since you have less work to do! It’s easier to clean and it works better than tying something messy.2. Use high-tech shampoo, conditioner and conditioner, which usually comes in three shades. Then, use a microfiber brush to remove and reapply hair (if you’re not wearing any makeup).3. After you’re done, rinse with cold water and leave it on the towel. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you think? Would you try it? &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Top photo of the French Braid.

Her hair is really loose but the braids are straight-through, so they make her look like a genius with a tomboy style. Plus, her bridesmaids outfit is pretty.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dress was actually inspired by a New York City style video she loved. “I had to put on this navy dress (it’s actually vintage), because I’d been wearing the same dress in Manhattan all summer and I’d been in all sorts of situations where I didn’t feel good about myself and just got married at that exact moment. But now I’m like, why did you choose a new style?”&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the second dress was from one of the original designers of “The New York Times”, who was also one of the women in the wedding. I think she also did a lot of her own research about New York fashion — including modeling and her own short skirts and dresses — to see if it might make a difference.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;']"

Here, she shares her beauty routine, five easy dishes she’ve used, and her most important makeup trick…&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Skin Tinted Lip Balm. This simple, creamy mask and lipstick is the perfect way to add a pop of color to any look. My friend Lili took mine for her New York City bike ride, and it’s perfect for days of outdoor adventures and romantic dinners. I love that it is made from cotton, so it’s light and smooth. And for summer trips, I’m obsessed with the Everlane Nourishing Cream for dry skin. You get this in five ingredients, all of which work really well in combination.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Lipstick Duo. This liquid lip color works best on people with oily skin, but is also very easy to apply and has incredible staying power. The Duo is a soft and creamy moisturizer that makes your skin glow and brighten up, even after you’ve washed your face with the oil. After applying, I feel like I’m not wearing much makeup, but this makes things look natural. It goes on smoothly, so you don’t have any redness or uneven texture on your face. &lt;p&gt;']"

We’re always going to have a few different products on the shelf, but I try to stay at home and not be too excited about products. As a mother, I’ve been told that my skin has to be clean to avoid irritation and inflammation. I find that a lot of products can be drying out my skin. My skin is the most sensitive part, so I have to be gentle and don’t want the products to smell like I’m wearing makeup. When I’m doing an activity, I’ll add a bit of water to get rid of any dead skin cells, and it will help you feel comfortable in that little area. I also try to use a highlighter in the morning, since it’s the same color.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;']"

They’re the ones who end up running from the Nazis and getting their ass handed to them.” &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now my mom is furious with me for her reaction. “You have to be kidding me,” she says, when asked about the movie. “It’s a little racist that way, but it makes me proud to have that choice.”&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are a few key points: &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children of color are killed every year in the U.S. from 1973 to 1989, and their lives are reputedly reduced to torture, killing, maiming and dissection. “The movie makes them’s take on black history.” It explains that the majority of black kids are either Black or Chic, but that there’s a distinct lack of respect, and the racist mindset often makes them feel as though they’re being persecuted. “The kids are getting ripped off by the Nazis and getting their ass handed to them.”&lt;p&gt;']"

We’ve grown up in one-and-a-half-square-feet, so we basically had to move to the backwater. It’s still pretty small but for our space, it’s really relaxed.

It’s easy to apply with your face, but leave it on for a few hours (or until you reach the point where you forget to apply it). (I used to use this mask on my face, but it made my hair look brown and clumpy.)&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Black Turtleneck Mask: For daytime wear, this is a pretty mask that’s made to be worn every morning. It works so well with masks and even coats. You just pull it over your face and put it on top of your head and chin. It does wonders for your complexion, too. Just take it off and do it again.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Turtleneck Jacket: If you’re looking for a more natural look, this Turtleneck Jacket is an easy choice. You put it on with your hair and it instantly exfoliates without any scent. It’s especially lovely on kids, where it’s easier to wear with little makeup. &lt;p&gt;']"

That’s when I realized, ‘Holy cow! You’re really straight! You’re so graceful and beautiful!’ Well, I was wrong! It turns out that my curly hair was actually based on what I had been eating when I shaved my head first. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was growing up, I did a lot of self-care rituals. I would wash my hair with shampoo and conditioner every day until it became light enough to get rid of any impurities.

It was very important to me for a long time, and I was pretty into that — until I discovered this method.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thoughts? What are you good at?

0,3, The Most Beautiful Man in the World,"['&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest reasons people buy things is just how gorgeous they are. When we bought our first house, in California, the first thing we noticed was the beautiful white walls. Since then, we’ve been hooked. Every time I walk into the house, I see a pretty woman with long blond hair and brown eyes. You never know who might get in. They’re always trying to impress. Plus, you feel the same way you do at the office — you just know they’re there.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently went out to dinner with my family, and it was almost the best meal of my life (and another day at the office). I’ve seen so many women who have beautiful bodies — my mom-to-be, my aunt-to-be, my best friend-to-be.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had a lovely conversation. She reminded me of a favorite scene from Mad Men: “She’s the prettiest man in the world.

But instead of glowing red, it actually looked like a cloudless sky. It was beautiful to see — almost a million trees blooming on the forest floor.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Afterward, Toby walked around the village with his dog, and we all fell into conversation. Toby loved to sing along to his beloved ""I Got a Gun"" and played around with woodcutters’ sticks and hammers, which he said were the best he could find.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the afternoon, we headed up the ridge to the lighthouse, and it was beautiful. It was just a small cove with little pools, but the views were incredible, especially after a huge wave.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, we ate dinner, watched a movie, and played ping pong.&lt;p&gt;']"

I learned how to make good choices and how to use natural chemicals — something I learned over and over. Today, I’m a director at Clinique in San Francisco and have been using their natural ingredients since. As a mom of three grown-ups, I really have a hard time understanding the limits of how much I can give or take. I’m always amazed by how much I can take with me — especially on my nails. I love that they have both natural and organic ingredients that I can use as a preservative. I’m always amazed by their affordable prices and the variety of colors and products they have.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about you about beauty?In the past, I have been obsessed with nail polish and have been searching for products that would be affordable and have the perfect combination of natural and chemical properties. So I started using this color treatment that has long been available on sale. It has lasted me around 25 years. In recent years, my life has also changed, and I don’t want to be living a boring life. I’m inspired by the beauty of my grandma, who made such beautiful nail polish. She gave her daughter the beauty she deserves to live. I love her attitude, she always looks great and wears a bow tie. &lt;p&gt;']"

Alex made these little bags for us (he always leaves his phone in the bag in case of a trip) and ordered all the new ones for me at a low price.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also made two other friends over at Sommelier.com, and our friend Emily had the best tea I’ve ever had. We sat on a patio overlooking the beach, where he had a delicious white one, which he poured right off the top of his mug. We ended up tasting and drinking that special kind of tea, which would get us hooked!

As a single woman who has had three children, and the new baby in tow, I feel like the perfect mom for her four-year-old, I can’t wait to show you how to get married! Here are five easy steps…&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Take photos. I use my iPhone to send photo cards, but if I want to go all out, I would also send a couple photos instead, so I can take photos of my bride’s legs. That way, when she comes over, I can send her photos in the future.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Set up a table for your wedding, if needed. As a couple, we don’t typically do anything for guests unless they’re absolutely certain we want to have the ceremony and dinner planned.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Check in with the bride. We generally get a good look at the ceremony before going to sleep, so I check it in advance. This takes us two to three hours!&lt;p&gt;']"

In addition, Boeing received a $2.5 million gift from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to buy a second rocket built by SpaceX Inc. The program, described as “an opportunity to leverage NASA’s proven expertise in the development of rocket launch systems,” will provide flexibility for companies, including Boeing, SpaceX and others, Boeing spokesman Mike Hurst said. Boeing is an investor in SpaceX and Boeing is a member of NASA’s National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s mission is to ensure the U.S. military is prepared for the eventuality of a manned space station by 2024. NASA also awarded NASA $8.5 billion to purchase four additional Falcon 9 rockets built by Boeing. Boeing previously was part of a consortium of four companies to build three new rocket launch systems, called the SpaceX Super Heavy, that will propel the U.S. military and commercial space travelers to and from the International Space Station. SpaceX founder Elon Musk’s space company, Space Exploration Technologies, has said it is developing a space station for the first time. Boeing has a contract to build two Falcon 9 rockets for SpaceX but no plans for one yet. The award, announced on Tuesday at the White House, marks the latest round in NASA’s efforts to build reusable launch vehicles. Since 2012, NASA has awarded Lockheed Martin Corp $7.2 billion to build a separate launch system that can be launched and landed by SpaceX and Boeing. That was the first step for SpaceX and Boeing.

The researchers said in a paper on Monday they had studied four juveniles of the genus Pegasus from 1970 to 1980. They identified four distinct fossilous juvenile features and identified four more that may have had adaptations to the fossil, including three arms and two legs.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pegasus, the second-line ancestor of Homo sapiens, lived more than 2 million years ago in an area of Madagascar that was much warmer than today’s Madagascar. The researchers said they found the two-legged species to have been closely related to the previously discovered species.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The species Pegasus was probably more primitive than previously believed, suggesting some features such as the legs may have allowed the animals to traverse the cave. Fossils unearthed in Peru show a lower jawbone, as well as a longer lower jaw bone that is likely indicative of a stronger jaw.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fossils identified by French paleontologists were the oldest of the four that were previously identified.

In addition, Friedman noted, studies are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of different types of TB treatments. “However, the potential for large trial trials is huge.” The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported this week that there were more than 21,000 cases of tuberculosis, an illness spread through coughing, sneezing and diarrhea.

PIPE is a nonprofit group whose goal is to bring a new era of internet censorship to a community facing growing opposition from tech companies, activists and journalists. The lawsuit was filed by an alliance of organizations called Digital Media Alliance (DLNA) and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The suit accused the Marshals Service of violating its civil rights, and the agency has filed several motions for writ of certiorari in support of its case. PIPE's legal team in California argued that the law requires it to use a subpoena to obtain documents from the Marshals Service. The Marshals Service declined to comment.
